"Nay," said Sir Lancelot "... for once shamed may never be recovered."
In the castle of Benwick, the French boy was looking at his face in the polished surface of a kettle-hat. It flashed in the sunlight with the stubborn gleam of metal. It was practically the same as the steel helmet which soldiers still wear, and it did not make a good mirror, but it was the best he could get. He turned the hat in various directions, hoping to get an average idea of his face from the different distortions which the bulges made. He was trying to find out what he was, and he was afraid of what he would find.
The boy thought that there was something wrong with him. All through his life-- even when he was a great man with the world at his feet--he was to feel this gap: something at the bottom of his heart of which he was aware, and ashamed, but which he did not understand. There is no need for us to try to understand it. We do not have to dabble in a place which he preferred to keep secret.
The Armoury, where the boy stood, was lined with weapons of war. For the last two hours he had been whirling a pair of dumb-bells in the air--he called them "poises"--and singing to himself a song with no words and no tune. He was fifteen. He had just come back from England, where his father King Ban of Benwick had been helping the English King to quell a rebellion. You remember that Arthur wanted to catch his knights young, to train them for the Round Table, and that he had noticed Lancelot at the feast, because he was winning most of the games.
Lancelot, swinging his dumb-bells fiercely and making his wordless noise, had been thinking of King Arthur with all his might. He was in love with him. That was why he had been swinging the poises. He had been remembering all the words of the only conversation which he had held with his hero.
The King had called him over when they were embarking for France--after he had kissed King Ban good-bye-- and they had gone alone into a corner of the ship. The heraldic sails of Ban's fleet, and the sailors in the rigging, and the armed turrets and archers and seagulls, like flake-white, had been a background to their conversation.
"Lance," the King had said, "come here a moment, will you?"
"Sir."
"I was watching you playing games at the feast."
"Sir."
"You seemed to win most of them."

Lancelot squinted down his nose.
"I want to get hold of a lot of people who are good at games, to help with an idea I have. It is for the time when I am a real King, and have got this kingdom settled. I was wondering whether you would care to help, when you are old enough?"
The boy had made a sort of wriggle, and had suddenly flashed his eyes at the speaker.
"It is about knights," Arthur had continued. "I want to have an Order of Chivalry, like the Order of the Garter, which goes about fighting against Might. Would you like to be one of those?"
"Yes."
The King had looked at him closely, unable to see whether he was pleased or frightened or merely being polite.
"Do you understand what I am talking about?"
Lancelot had taken the wind out of his sails.
"We call it Fort Mayne in France," he had explained. "The man with the strongest arm in a clan gets made the head of it, and does what he pleases. That is why we call it Fort Mayne. You want to put an end to the Strong Arm, by having a band of knights who believe in justice rather than strength. Yes, I would like to be one of those very much. I must grow up first. Thank you. Now I must say good-bye."
So they had sailed away from England--the boy standing in the front of the ship and refusing to look back, because he did not want to show his feelings. He had already fallen in love with Arthur on the night of the wedding feast, and he carried with him in his heart to France the picture of that bright northern king, at supper, flushed and glorious tram his wars.
Behind the black eyes which were searching intently in the kettle-hat there was a dream which had come to him the previous night. Seven hundred years ago--or it may have been fifteen hundred according to Malory's notation--people took dreams as seriously as the psychiatrists do today, and Lancelot's had been a disturbing one. It was not disturbing because of anything it might mean--for he had not the least idea of its meaning--but because it had left him with a sense of loss. This was what it was.
Lancelot and his young brother, Ector Demaris, had been sitting in two chairs. They got out of these chairs and were mounted on two horses. Lancelot said: "Go we, and seek that which we shall not find." So they did. But a Man or a Power set upon Lancelot, and beat him and despoiled him, and clothed him in another array which was full of knots, and made him ride on an ass instead of on the horse. Then there was a beautiful well, with the fairest waters he had ever seen, and he got off his ass to drink out of it. It seemed to him that there could be nothing in the world more beautiful than to drink of this well But as soon as he stooped his lips toward it, the water sank away. It went right down into the barrel of the well, sinking and
sinking from him so that he could not get it It made him feel desolate, to be abandoned by the water of the well

Arthur and the well, and the dumb-bells which were to make him worthy of Arthur, and the ache in his tired arms from swinging them--all these were at the back of the boy's mind as he tilted the tin hat backward and forward between his fingers, but there was a more insistent thought in his head also. It was a thought about the face in the metal, and about the thing which must have gone wrong in the depths of his spirit to make a face like that He was not a self-deceiver. He knew that whichever way he turned the morion, it would tell him the same story. He had already decided that when he was a grown knight he would give himself a melancholy title. He was the eldest son, so he was bound to be knighted, but he would not call himself Sir Lancelot. He would call himself the Chevalier Mai Fet-- the Ill-Made Knight.
So far as he could see--and he felt that there must be some reason for it somewhere--the boy's face was as ugly as a monster's in the King's menagerie. He looked like an African ape.
2 Lancelot ended by being the greatest knight King Arthur had. He was a sort of Bradman, top of the battling averages. Tristram and Lamorak were second and third.
But you have to remember that people can't be good at cricket unless they teach themselves to be so, and that jousting was an art, just as cricket is. It was like cricket in many ways. There was a scorer's pavilion at a tournament, with a real scorer inside it, who made marks on the parchment just like the mark for one run which is made by the cricket scorer today. The people, walking round the ground in their best frocks, from Grand Stand to Refreshment Tent, must have found the fighting very like the game. It took a frightfully long time--Sir Lancelot's innings frequently lasted all day, if he were battling against a good knight--and the movements had a feeling of slow-motion, because of the weight of armour. When the sword-play had begun, the combatants stood opposite each other in the green acre like batsman and bowler--except that they stood closer together--and perhaps Sir Gawaine would start with an in-swinger, which Sir Lancelot would put away to leg with a beautiful leg-glide, and then Lancelot would reply with a yorker under Gawaine's guard--it was called "foining"-- and all the people round the field would clap. King Arthur might turn to Guenever in the Pavilion, and remark that the great man's footwork was as lovely as ever. The knights had little curtains on the back of their helms, to keep the hot sun off the metal, like the handkerchief which cricketers will sometimes arrange behind their caps today.
Knightly exercise was as much an art as cricket is, and perhaps the only way in which Lancelot did not resemble Bradman was that he was more graceful. He did not have that crouching on the bat and hopping out to the pitch of the ball. He was more like Woolley. But you can't be like Woolley by simply sitting still and wanting to be so.
The Armoury, where the small boy who was later to be Sir Lancelot was standing with his morion, was the largest single room in the castle of Benwick. It was to be the room in which this boy was to spend most of his waking hours for the next three years.
The rooms of the main castle--which he could see from the windows--were mostly small, because people can't afford to build for luxury when they are making a fortification. Round the inner fort with its small rooms there was a wide byre, or shell-keep, into which the castle herds were driven during a siege. This was surrounded by a high wall with towers, and, on the inner side of this wall, the big rooms which were needed for stores, barns, barracks, and

stables were built. The Armoury was one of these rooms. It stood between the stables, for fifty horses, and the cowsheds. The best family armour--the bits which were actually in use-- was kept in a little room in the castle itself, and it was only the arms of the troops, and the spare parts of the family stuff, and the things which were needed for gymnastics, practice, or physical training, which reposed in the Armoury.
Under the raftered ceiling, and the nearest to it, there hung or leaned a collection of bannerettes and pennoncels, blazoned with the Ban charges--France Ancient, as they are now called--which would be needed on various occasions. Along the wall there were tilting lances, resting horizontally on nails so that they should not warp. These looked like bars for exercises in a gymnasium. In one corner a collection of old lances which had already warped or got injured in some way, but which might still be useful for something, were standing upright. A rack, running the whole length of the second main wall, held the infantry issue of mail habergeons with mittens, spears, morions, and Bordeaux swords. King Ban was fortunate in living at Benwick, for the Bordeaux swords were local and particularly good. Then there were harness-barrels, in which the armour was packed in hay for expeditions overseas--some of it was still packed from the last expedition, and a curious mixture it was. Uncle Dap, who looked after the Armoury, had been unpacking one of the barrels to make an inventory of its contents--and had gone away in despair on discovering ten pounds of dates and five loaves of sugar in it It must have been some sort of honey sugar, unless it was loaf sugar brought back from the Crusades. He had left his list beside the barrel, and this recorded, among other articles: a salade garnessed with golde, iij peire gantelez, a vestment, a mesbooke, an auter cloth, a peir of brigandines, a pyssying basin of silver, x schertes for my Lord, a jakete of leather, and a bagge of chessmen. Then, in an alcove formed by the harness- barrels, there was a set of shelves which formed the dispensary for sick armour. On the shelves there were huge bottles of olive oil--nowadays they prefer a mineral oil for armour, but they did not understand such niceties in Lancelot's time--together with boxes of fine sand for polishing, bags of brigandine nails at eleven shillings and eightpence the twenty thousand, rivets, spare rings for chain mail, leather skins for cutting new straps and bases for the knee harness, together with a thousand other details then fascinating, but now lost to us. There were gambesons like the pads which the goalkeeper wears in hockey, or like the quilted protections which Americans have at football. In various corners there were pushed, so as to leave a free space in the middle of the room, a collection of gymnastic apparatus such as quintains and so on, while Uncle Dap's desk stood near the door. On the desk there were splattering quill pens, blotting sand, sticks for beating Lancelot when he was stupid, and notes, in unutterable confusion, as to which jupons had lately been pawned--pawning was a great institution for valuable armour--and which helms had been brought up to date with a glancing surface, and whose vambrace stood in need of repair, and what had been paid to whom for fforbeshynge which when. Most of the accounts were wrongly added up.
Three years may seem a long time for a boy to spend in one room, if he only goes out of it to eat and sleep and to practise tilting in the field. It is even difficult to imagine a boy who would do it, unless you realize from the start that Lancelot was not romantic and debonair. Tennyson and the Pre-Raphaelites would have found it difficult to recognize this rather sullen and unsatisfactory child, with the ugly face, who did not disclose to anybody that he was living on dreams and prayers. They might have wondered what store of ferocity he had against himself, that could set him to break his own body so young. They might have wondered why he was so strange.
To begin with, he had to spend the weary months charging against Uncle Dap, with a blunt
spear under his arm. Uncle Dap, armed cap-a-pie, would sit on a stool--and Lancelot, with the morne-headed spear, would charge and charge against him, learning the best lodges on armour for a point. Then there were lonely hours with poises, with many other hours out of doors--before he was even allowed to touch real arms--in which he learned various kinds of throwing, casting with the sling-stick or the casting spear, and tossing the bar. After that, after a year of toil, there was his promotion to the pel-quintain. It was a stake driven upright in the ground, and he had to fight against it with sword and shield--rather like shadow-boxing, or using a punch-ball. He had to use arms for this exercise which weighed twice as much as the ordinary sword and shield. Sixty pounds was considered a good weight for the arms used on the pel-quintain--so that, when he did come at length to the usual weapons, he would wield them featly. They would seem light by comparison. The final stage of breaking to the cricket standard was by mock combats. In these at last, and after all the bitter setbacks of discipline, he was allowed to fight battles which were nearly real ones, against his brother and cousins. The combats were held under strict rules. They might begin with a cast of the spear blunted, followed by seven strokes with the sword, point and edge rebated, "without close, or griping one another with the handes, upon paine of punishment as the judges for the time being shall thinke requisite." It was not lawful in these matches to foin--that is, to make a thrust of the point. Finally there was swashbuckling. The now vigorous boy might go at his companions harum-scarum, with sword and buckler.
If you have been down in one of the old-fashioned diving suits which used to be standard in the Royal Navy before frogmen and free diving came along, you will know why divers move slowly. A diver has forty pounds of lead on each foot and two plaques of lead--each weighing fifty pounds--one on his back and one on his chest. These are apart from the weight of the suit and the helmet. Except when he is in the sea, he weighs twice as much as a man. When he has to step over a rope or an air-tube on deck, it is hard work--like climbing a wall. If you push him from in front, the weight behind him tends to take over, so that he might fall backwards. The same thing happens vice versa. Practised divers become adept at dealing with these handicaps, and can hoist those forty pound feet up and down the ship's ladder fairly nimbly--but an amateur half kills himself with the mere toil of movement. Lancelot, like the diver, had to learn to be nimble against the force of gravity.
Knights-in-armour were like divers in more ways than one.
Apart from their helmets and encumbrances and the difficulty of breathing, they had to be dressed in their suits by kind and careful assistants. They had to rely on these assistants to do it properly. A diver puts his life in the hands of the ratings who are dressing him. These young men, like pages or squires, mother him with great tenderness and concentration and with a sort of protective respect They always address him by his title, not by bis name. They say, "Sit down, diver," or "Now the left foot, diver," or "Diver Two, can you hear me on the inter-com?"
It is good to put your life in other people's hands.
Three years of it. The other boys did not worry, for they had other things to think about--but for the ugly one it was the whole of an obscure and mystic life. He had to perfect himself for Arthur as somebody who was good at games, and he had to think about the theories of chivalry even when he was in bed at night. He had to teach himself to possess a sound opinion on hundreds of disputed points --on the proper length of weapons, or the cut of a mantling, or the articulation of a pauldron, or whether cedarwood was better than ash for
spears, as Chaucer seems to have believed.
Here ia a short example of the problems of chivalry, which he thought about in his early times. There was a knight once called Reynaud de Roy, who had a tilting match with another one called John de Holland. Reynaud purposely fastened his tilting helm--the huge straw- padded drum which sometimes fitted over the helmet proper--so that it was loose. When John of Holland's spear point struck it, it simply fell off. This meant that the helm came off Reynaud, instead of Reynaud coming off his horse. An effective trick, but a dangerous one-- the whole of chivalry argued about it for a long time, some saying that it was unsporting, some that it was fair but too risky, and some that it was a good idea.
Three years of discipline made Lancelot, not a merry heart and a capacity for singing tirra- lirra. Out of a lifetime which at his age must have seemed to stretch little more than a week ahead, he gave thirty-six months to another man's idea because he was in love with it. He supported himself meanwhile on daydreams. He wanted to be the best knight in the world, so that Arthur would love him in return, and he wanted one other thing which was still possible in those days. He wanted, through his purity and excellence, to be able to perform some ordinary miracle--to heal a blind man or something like that, for instance.
 There was a feature about the great families which centred round the doom of Arthur. All three had a resident genius of the family, half-way between a tutor and a confidant, who affected the characters of the children in each. At Sir Ector's castle there had been Merlyn, who was the main influence in Arthur's life. In lonely and distant Lothian there had been St. Toirdealbhach, whose warlike philosophy must have had something to do with the clannishness of Gawaine and his brothers. In King Ban's castle there was an uncle of Lancelot's, whose name was Gwenbors. Actually he was the old man we have met, known to everybody as Uncle Dap, but his given name was Gwenbors. In those days you generally named your children in the same way as we name foxhounds and foals today. If you happened to be Queen Morgause and had four children, you put a G in all their names (Gawaine, Agravaine, Gaheris, and Gareth)-- and, naturally if your brothers happened to be called Ban and Bors, you were doomed to be called Gwenbors yourself. It made it easier to remember who you were.
Uncle Dap was the only one in the family who took Lancelot seriously, and Lancelot was the one who was serious about Uncle Dap. It was easy not to be serious about the old fellow, for he was that peculiar creation which ignorant people laugh at--a genuine maestro. His branch of learning was chivalry. There was not a piece of armour proofed in Europe but what Uncle Dap had a theory about it. He was furious with the new Gothic style, with its ridges and scallop-patterns and fluting. He considered it ridiculous to wear armour like the ropework on a Nelson sideboard, for it was obvious that every groove would be liable to hold a point The whole object of good armour, he said, was to throw the point off--and, when he thought of the people in Germany making their horrible furrows, he nearly went frantic. There was
nothing in Heraldry which he did not know. If anybody committed any of the grosser errors --such as putting metal on metal or colour on colour--he became electrified with passion. His long white moustaches quivered at their tips like antennae, the ends of his fingers came together in gestures of the wildest passion, and he waved his arms and jumped up and down and wagged his eyebrows and almost fizzed. Nobody can be a maestro without being subject to these excitements, so Lancelot seldom minded when he got his face slapped in a melee
about shields cut-a-bouche or about whether it was a good idea to have a guige on your shield or not Sometimes Uncle Dap was tantalized into beating him, but he bore that also. In those days they did.
One reason for not minding Uncle Dap's transports was that everything the boy wanted could be learned from him. He was not only a distinguished clerk and authority on his own subjects--he was also one of the finest swordsmen in France. It was for this, really, that the boy had attached himself. It was in order to rase and trace and foin under the brutal tuition of genius--in order to hold out a heavy sword at arm's length in a lunge until he felt he would split in half only to have Uncle Dap catch hold of his point and pull him into a crueler stretch.
Ever since he could remember, there had been the excited man with the eyes of blue steel, jumping up and down, and snapping his fingers, and shouting out as if life itself depended on it: "Doublez! Dedoublez! Dagagez! Un! Deux!"
One fine day in late summer, Lancelot was sitting in the Armoury with his uncle. In the big room there was a lot of dust dancing in the sunbeams, dust which they had thelmselves been stirring up a moment before, and round the walls there were the ranks of polished armour, and the rack of spears, and helms and morions hanging on pegs. There were misericordes and harness and the various banners and pennoncels, blazoned with the Ban chargers. The two fencers had sat down to rest after an exciting bout, and Uncle Dap was blown. Lancelot was eighteen now. He was a better fencer than his maestro--though Uncle Dap would not admit it, and his pupil tactfully pretended that he was not.
A page came in while they were still panting, and told him that he was wanted by his mother. "Why?"
The page said that a gentleman had arrived who wanted to see him, and the Queen had said that he was to come at once.
Queen Elaine was sitting in the solar, where she had been doing tapestry work, and her two guests were sitting on either side of her. She was not the Elaine who had been one of the Cornwall sisters. It was a popular name in those days and several women ini the Morte d'Arthur had it, particularly as some of its manuscript sources have got mixed up. The three grown-ups at the long table looked like a row of examiners in the dim room. One of the guests was an elderly gentleman with a white beard and pointed hat, and the other was a handsome minx with an olive complexion and plucked eyebrows. They all three looked at Lancelot, and the old gentleman spoke first. "Hum!" They waited.
"You called him Galahad," said the old gentleman. "His first name Was Galahad," he added, "and now he is Lancelot, since he was confirmed." "However did you know?"
"It can't be helped," said Merlyn. "It is one of the things one does know, and there's an end on't. Now, let me see, what are the other things I was supposed to tell you?"
The young lady with the plucked eyebrows put her hand before her mouth and yawned gracefully, like a cat
"He will get the hope of his heart thirty years from now, and he will be the best knight in the world." "Shall I live to see it?" asked Queen Elaine. Merlyn scratched his head, gave it a
bump on the top with his knuckles, and replied: "Yes."
"Well, " said the Queen, "it is all very wonderful, I must say. Do you hear that, Lance? You are to be the best knight in the world!"
The boy asked: "Have you come from the court of King Arthur?"
"Yes."
"Is everything well?"
"Yes. He sent you his love."
"Is the King happy?"
"Very happy. Guenever sent her love too."
"Who is Guenever?"
"Good gracious!" exclaimed the magician. "Didn't you know about that? No, of course not I have been getting be-jingled in my brains."
Here he glanced at the beautiful lady, as if she might be responsible for the jingling--which she was. She was Nimue, and he had fallen in love with her at last
"Guenever," said Nimue, "is Arthur's new queen. They have been married for some time."
"Her father is King Leodegrance," explained Merlyn. "He gave Arthur a present of a round table when they were married, and a hundred knights to go with it There is room at the table for a hundred and fifty."
Lancelot said: "Oh!"
"The King meant to tell you," said Merlyn, "Perhaps the messenger got drowned on the way over. There may have been a storm. He really did mean to tell you."
"Oh," said the boy, for the second time.
Merlyn began to talk quickly, because he saw that it was a difficult situation. From Lancelot's face he could not tell whether he was hurt or whether it was like that always.
"He has only managed to fill in twenty-nine of the seats so far," he said. "There is room for twenty-one more. Plenty of room. All the knights' names are written on them in gold."
There was a pause, during which nobody knew what to say. Then Lancelot cleared his throat.
"There was a boy," he said, "when I was in England. His name was Gawaine. Has he been made one of the knights of the table?"
Merlyn looked guilty, and nodded his head.
The Ill-Made Knight T.H. White
"He was created on the day Arthur was married."
"I see."
There was another long pause.
"This lady," said Merlyn, feeling that he had better fill in the silence, "is called Nimue. I am in love with her. We are having a sort of honeymoon together--only it is a magical one--and now we shall have to be off to Cornwall. I am sorry we could not visit you for longer."
"My dear Merlyn," exclaimed the Queen, "but surely you will stay the night?"
"No, no. Thank you. Thank you very much. We are in a hurry just now."
"You will have a glass of something before you leave?"
"No, thank you. It is very kind of you, but really, we must be off. We have some magic to attend to in Cornwall."
"Such a short visit--" began the Queen.
Merlyn cut her short by standing up and taking Nimue's hand in his.
"Good-bye now," he said with determination--and in a couple of spins they were both gone.
Their bodies were gone, but the magician's voice remained in the air.
"That's that," they could hear him saying in a relieved tone. "Now then, my angel, what about that place I was telling you of in Cornwall, the one with the magical cave in it?"
Lancelot went back to Uncle Dap in the Armoury, with slow steps. He stood in front of his uncle, and bit his lip.
"I am going to England," he said.
Uncle Dap looked at him in amazement, but said nothing.
"I shall start this evening."
"It seems sudden," said Uncle Dap. "Your mother does not usually make up her mind so quickly."
"My mother does not know."
"Do you mean that you are going to run away?"
"If I told my mother and father, there would only be a fuss," he said. "It is not that I am running away. I shall come back again. But I must go to England as quick as I can."
"Do you expect me not to tell your mother?"
"Yes, I do."
Uncle Dap gnawed the ends of his moustache, and wrung his hands.
"If they get to know that I could have prevented it," he said, "Ban will cut off my head."
"They will not know," said the boy indifferently, and he went away to arrange about his packing.
A week later, Lancelot and Uncle Dap were sitting in a peculiar boat in the middle of the English Channel. The boat had a sort of castle at each end. There was another castle half-way up the single mast, which gave it the appearance of a dovecote. It had flags fore and aft The one gay sail had a Cross Potent on it, while an enormous streamer floated from the top of the mast. There were eight oars, and the two passengers were seasick.
 The hero-worshipper rode towards Camelot with a bitter heart. It was hard for him at eighteen to have given his life to a king, only to be forgotten--hard to have spent those sorrowful hours with the heavy arms in the dust of the Armoury, only to see Sir Gawaine knighted first--hardest of all to have broken his body for the older man's ideal, only to find this mincing wife stepping in at the end of it to snatch away his love at no cost at all. Lancelot was jealous of Guenever, and he was ashamed of himself for being so.
Uncle Dap rode behind the grieving boy in silence. He knew a thing which the other was still too green to know-- that he had taught the finest knight in Europe. Like an excited tit which had nursed a cuckoo, Uncle Dap fluttered along behind his prodigy. He was carrying the fighting harness, which was strapped up in apple-pie order according to his own dodges and wrinkles--for, from now on, he was Lancelot's squire.
They came to a clearing in the wood, and a little stream ran through the middle. There was a ford here and the stream ran tinkling over the clean stones, only a few inches deep. The sun shone down into the clearing. Some wood-pigeons sang drowsily their Take Two Cows Taffy, and, on the other side of the musical water, there was an enormous knight in black armour with his tilting helm in position. He sat motionless on a black charger, and his shield was still in its canvas case. It was impossible to read his blazon. Being so still, so portly in his iron sheath, and having the great blind helm over his head so that he had no proper face, he had a look of danger about him. You did not know what he was thinking, nor what action he might be going to take. He was a menace.
Lancelot halted, and so did Uncle Dap. The black knight walked his horse into the shallow water, and drew rein in front of them. He raised his lance in a gesture of salute, then pointed with it to a place behind Lancelot's back. Either he was telling him to go home again, or else he was pointing out a good position from which they could start their charges. Whichever the case might be, Lancelot saluted with his gauntlet and turned round to go to the place. He took one of his spears from Uncle Dap, pulled his tilting helm round in front of him--it had been hanging behind on a chain--and lifted the steel turret into position on his head. He laced it on. Now he too had become a man without an expression.
The two knights faced each other from opposite ends of the little glade. Then, although neither of them had so far spoken a word, they fewtered their spears, put spurs to their horses, and began to charge. Uncle Dap, drawn up safely behind a near-by tree, could hardly contain his delight. He knew what was going to happen to thd black knight, although Lancelot did not know, and he began to snap his fingers.
The first time you do a thing, it is often exciting. To go alone in an airplane for the first time used to be so exciting that it nearly choked you. Lancelot had never ridden a serious joust before--and, although he had charged at hundreds of quintains and thousands of rings, he had never taken his life in his hands in earnest. In the first moment of the charge, he felt to himself: "Well, now I am off. Nothing can help me now." In the second moment he settled down to behave automatically, in the same way as he had always behaved with the quintain and the rings.
The point of his spear took the black knight under the rim of his shoulder-harness at exactly the right place. His mount was in full gallop, and the black knight's was still in a canter. The black knight and his horse revolved rapidly toward their sinister side, left the ground together in a handsome parabola, and came down again with a clash. As Lancelot rode by, he could see them sprawling on the ground together, with the knight's broken lance between the horse's legs and one flashing horse-shoe tearing the canvas from the fallen shield. The man and the horse were mixed together. Each was afraid of the other, and each was kicking against the other in the effort to be parted. Then the horse got up on its forelegs, its haunches heaved upright, and the knight sat up, lifting one steel gauntlet, as if to rub his head. Lancelot reined in and rode back to him.
Generally, when one knight had given another a fall with the lance, the fallen one used to lose his temper, blame the fall on his horse, and insist upon fighting it out with swords on foot The usual excuse was to say: "The son of a mare hath failed me, but I wote well my father's sword never shall"
The black knight, however, did not do the usual thing. He was evidently a more cheerful kind of person than the colour of his armour would suggest, for he sat up and blew through the split of his helm, making a note of surprise and admiration. Then he took off the helm and mopped his brow. The shield, whose cover the horse's hoof had torn, bore, or, a dragon rampant gules.
Lancelot threw his spear into a bush, got off his horse very quickly, and knelt down beside the knight. All his love was back again inside him. It was typical of Arthur not to lose his temper, typical of him to sit on the ground making noises of admiration when he had just been given a great fall.
"Sir," said Lancelot, taking off his own helm with a humble gesture; and he bowed his head in the French fashion.
The King began scrambling to his feet in great excitement
"Lancelot!" he exclaimed. "Why, it's the boy Lancelot! You are the king's son of Benwick. I remember seeing you when he came over for the Battle of Bedegraine. What a fall! I never saw anything like it Where did you learn to do this? It was terrificl Were you coming to my Court? How is King Ban? How is your charming mother? Really, my dear chap, this is
magnificent!"
Lancelot looked up at the breathless King, who held out both hands to help him to his feet, and his jealousy and grief were over.
They caught their horses and jogged off toward the palace side by side, forgetting Uncle Dap. They had so much to say to each other that they both talked all the time. Lancelot gave imaginary messages from King Ban or from Queen Elaine, and Arthur talked about how Gawaine had killed a lady. He told how King Pellinore had got so courageous since bis marriage that he had killed King Lot of Orkney by mistake in a tournament, and how the Round Table was going as well as could be expected, but very slowly, and how, now that Lancelot had arrived, everything would come right before they knew where they were.
He was knighted the first day--he might have been knighted at any time during the past two years, but he had refused to be done by anybody except Arthur--and he was introduced to Guenever the same evening. There is a story that her hair was yellow, but it was not. It was so black that it was startling, and her blue eyes, deep and clear, had a sort of fearlessness which was startling too. She was surprised by the young man's twisted face, but not frightened.
"Now," said the King, putting their hands together. "This is Lancelot, the one I told you about He is going to be the best knight I have. I never saw such a fall as he gave me. I want you to be kind to him, Gwen. His father is one of my oldest friends."
He kissed the Queen's hand coldly.
He did not notice anything particular about her, because his mind was filled with previous pictures which he had made for himself. There was no room for pictures of what she was really like. He thought of her only as the person who had robbed him, and, since robbers are deceitful, designing, and heartless people, he thought of her as these.
"How do you do?" asked the Queen.
Arthur said: "We shall have to tell him what has been happening since he went away. What a lot of things to tell! Where can we begin?"
"Begin with the Table," said Lancelot.
"Oh dear!"
The Queen laughed and smiled at the new knight.
"Arthur thinks about it all the time," she said. "He even dreams about it at night. He won't be able to tell you unless he talks for a week."
"It is not going badly," said the King. "You can't expect a thing like that to go smoothly the whole time. The idea is there, and people are beginning to understand it, and that is the great thing. I am sure it will work."
"What about the Orkney faction?"
The Ill-Made Knight T.H. White
"They will come round in time."
"Is that Gawaine?" inquired Lancelot. "What is the matter with the Orkney faction?"
The King looked uncomfortable. He said: "The real matter with them is Morgause, their mother. She brought them up with so little love or security that they find it difficult to understand warm-hearted people thelmselves. They are suspicious and frightened. They don't get hold of the idea as I wanted them to do. We have three of them here--Gawaine, Gaheris and Agravaine. It is not their fault"
"Arthur had his first Pentecost feast the year we were married," explained Guenever, "and sent everybody out looking for good adventures, to see how the idea would work. When they came back, Gawaine had cut a lady's head off, and even dear old Pellinore had failed to rescue a damsel in distress. Arthur was furious about it."
"It is not Gawaine's fault," said the King. "He is a nice fellow. I like him. It is the fault of that woman."
"I hope things have got better since then?"
"Yes. It is slow work, of course, but I am sure we could say that things have got better."
"Did Pellinore repent?"
Arthur said: "Pellinore repented, yes. There was not much to repent. It was one of his muddles. But the trouble is that he has got so valiant since he married the Queen's daughter of Flanders that he has taken to jousting in earnest, and quite often wins. I was telling you how he killed King Lot one day, when they were having a practice. It has created a great deal of ill-feeling. The Orkney children have sworn to revenge their father's death, and they are out on the warpath for poor old PeUinore's blood. I am having difficulty in making them behave."
"Lancelot will help you," said the Queen. "It will be nice to have an old friend to help."
"Yes, it will be nice. Now, Lance, I expect you will want to see your room."
It was the second half of summer, and the amateur falconers in Camelot were bringing their peregrines to the last stages of their training. If you are a clever falconer, you get your hawk on the wing quickly. If you are not, you are apt to make mistakes, and the result is that the hawk does not finish her training for some time. So all the falconers in Camelot were trying to show that they were clever ones-- by getting their hawks entered as quickly as possible-- and, in all directions, if you went for a walk in the fields, there were atrabilious hawk-masters stretching out their creances and quarrelling with their assistants. Hawking, as James the First pointed out, is an extreme stirrer up of passions. It is because the hawks thelmselves are furious creatures, and the people who associate with them catch it
Arthur presented Sir Lancelot with an inter-mewed jerfalcon, with which to keep himself amused. This was a great compliment, for jerfalcons were only supposed to be used by kings. At any rate that is what the Abbess Juliana Berners tell us--perhaps incorrectly. An emperor was allowed an eagle, a king could have a jerfalcon, and after that there was the peregrine for an earl, the merlin for a lady, the goshawk for a yeoman, the sparrow hawk for a priest, and
the musket for a holy-water clerk. Lancelot was pleased with his present, and settled down busily in competition with the other angry falconers, who were hard at work criticizing each other's methods and sending each other messages of sugary venom and getting yellow about the eyeballs.
The jerfalcon which had been given to Lancelot was not properly through her moult Like Hamlet, she was fat and scant of breath. Her long confinement in the mews, while she moulted, had got her into a sulky and temperamental state. So Lancelot had to fly her on the creance for several days before he could be sure that she was safe to the lure. If you have ever flown a hawk on a creance, which is a long line tied to the hawk's jesses so that she cannot fly away, you know what a nuisance the thing can be. Nowadays people use a fishing reel, which makes it easier to stretch it out and to wind it up--but in Lancelot's day there were no good reels, and you simply had to wind your creance into a ball, like string. There were two main horrors to which it was subject, the first of which was the horror peculiar to all balls of string--that they invariably became tangles instead of balls. The second was that if you flew the hawk in any field which had not been carefully mowed, the string became wound round thistles or tufts of grass, thus checking the hawk and doing damage to its training. So Lancelot, and all the other angry men, went circling round Camelot in a bitter atmosphere of knots and competition and bating hawks.
King Arthur had asked his wife to be kind to the young man. She was fond of her husband, and she realized that she had come between him and his friend. She was not such a fool as to try to atone to Lancelot for this, but she had taken a fancy for him as himself. She liked his broken face, however hideous it was, and Arthur had asked her to be kind. There was a shortage of assistants in Camelot for the hawking, because there were so many people at it. So Guen-ever began going with Lancelot to help him with the balls of string.
He did not take much notice of the woman. "Here comes that woman," he would remark to himself, or "There goes that woman." He was already deep in the hawking atmosphere, which was only partly an affair for females, and he seldom thought of her more than that. He had grown into a beautifully polite youth, in spite of his ugliness, and he was too self-conscious to allow himself to have petty thoughts for long. His jealousy had turned into unconsciousness of her existence. He went on with his hawk-mastery, thanking her politely for her help and accepting it with courtesy.
One day there was particular trouble with a thistle, and he had miscalculated the amount of food which ought to have been given the day before. The jerfalcon was in a foul temper, and Lancelot caught its mood. Guenever, who was not particularly good with hawks and had no special interest in them, was frightened by his frowning brow, and, because she was frightened, she became clumsy. She was sweetly trying her best to help, but she knew that she was not clever at falconry, and there was confusion in her mind. Very carefully and kindly, and with the best intentions, she wound the creance up quite wrong. He took the wretched ball away from her with a gesture which was almost rough.
"That's no good," he said, and he began to unwind her hopeful work with angry fingers. His eyebrows made a horrible scowl
There was a moment in which everything stood still. Guenever stood, hurt in her heart Lancelot, sensing her stillness, stood also. The hawk stopped bating and the leaves did not rustle.
The Ill-Made Knight T.H. White
The young man knew, in this moment, that he had hurt a real person, of his own age. He saw in her eyes that she thought he was hateful, and that he had surprised her badly. She had been giving kindness, and he had returned it with unkindness. But the main thing was that she was a real person. She was not a minx, not deceitful, not designing and heartless. She was pretty Jenny, who could think and feel.
The first two people to notice that Lancelot and Guenever were falling in love with each other were Uncle Dap and King Arthur himself. Arthur had been warned about this by Merlyn-- who was now safely locked up in his cave by the fickle Nimue--and he had been fearing it subconsciously. But he always hated knowing the future and had managed to dismiss it from his mind. Uncle Dap's reaction was to give his pupil a lecture, as they stood in the mews with the chastened jer.
"God's Feet!" said Uncle Dap, with other exclamations of the same kind. "What is this? What are you doing? Is the finest knight in Europe to throw away everything I have taught him for the sake of a lady's beautiful eyes? And a married lady too!"
"I don't know what you are talking about."
"Don't know! Won't know! Holy Mother!" shouted Uncle Dap. "Is it Guenever I am talking about, or is it not? Glory be to God for evermore!"
Lancelot took the old gentleman by the shoulders and sat him down on a chest.
"Look, Uncle," he said with determination. "I have been wanting to talk to you. Isn't it time you went back to Benwick?"
"Benwick!" cried his uncle, as if he had been stabbed to the heart.
"Yes, Benwick. You can't go on pretending to be my squire for ever. For one thing, you are the brother of two kings, and for another thing, you are three times as old as I am. It would be against the laws of arms."
"Laws of arms!" shouted the old man. "Pouf!"
"Well, it is no good saying Pouf."
"And me that has taught you everything you know! Me to go back to Benwick without having seen you prove yourself at all! Why, you have not even used your sword in front of me, not used Joyeux! It is ingratitude, perfidy, treachery! Sorrow to the grave! My faith! By the Blue!"
And the agitated old fellow went off into a long string of Gallic remarks, including the so- called William the Conqueror's oath of Per Splendorem Dei, and the Pasque Dieu which was the imaginary King Louis the Eleventh's idea of a joke. Inspired by the royal train of thought he added the exclamations of Rufus, Henry the First, John, and Henry the Third, which were, in that order, By the Holy Face of Lucca, By God's Death, By God's Teeth, and By God's Head. The jerfalcon, seeming to appreciate the display, roused his feathers heartily, like a
housemaid shaking a mop out of the window.
"Well, if you won't go, you won't," said Lancelot. "But please don't talk to me about the Queen. I can't help it if we are fond of each other, and there is nothing wrong in being fond of people, is there? It is not as if the Queen and I were villains. When you begin lecturing me about her, you are making it seem as if there was something wrong between us. It is as if you thought ill of me, or did not believe in my honour. Please do not mention the subject again."
Uncle Dap rolled his eyes, disarranged his hair, cracked his knuckles, kissed his finger-tips, and made other gestures calculated to express his point of view. But he did not refer to the love affair afterwards.
Arthur's reaction to the problem was complicated. Merlyn's warning about his lady and his best friend had contained within itself the seeds of its own contradiction, for your friend can hardly be your friend if he is also going to be your betrayer. Arthur adored his rose-petalled Guenever for her dash, and had an instinctive respect for Lancelot, which was soon to become affection. This made it difficult either to suspect them or not to suspect.
The conclusion which he came to was that it would be best to solve the problem by taking Lancelot with him to the Roman war. That, at any rate, would separate the boy from Guenever, and it would be pleasant to have his disciple with him--a fine soldier--whether Merlyn's warning were true or not.
The Roman war was a complicated business which had been brewing for years. It need not concern us long. It was in its way the logical consequence of Bedegraine--the continuation of that battle on a European scale. The feudal idea of war for ransom had been squashed in Britain, but not abroad, and now the foreign ransom-hunters were after the newly settled King. A gentleman called Lucius, who was the Dictator of Rome--and it is strange to reflect that Dictator is the very word which Malory uses--had sent an embassy asking for tribute from Arthur--it was called a tribute before a battle and a ransom afterward--to which the King, after consulting his parliament, had returned a message that no tribute was due. So the Dictator Lucius had declared war. He had also sent his messengers, like Lars Porsena in Macaulay, to all the points of the compass to gather allies. He had no less than sixteen kings marching with him from Rome into High Germany, on their way to do battle with the English. He had allies from Ambage, Arrage, Alisandrie, Inde, Hermonie, Euphrates, Affrike, Europe the Large, Ertaine, Elamie, Arabie, Egypt, Damaske, Damiete, Cayer, Capadoce, Tarce, Turkey, Pounce, Pampoille, Surrie and Galacie, beside others from Greece, Cyprus, Macedone, Calabre, Cateland, Portingale, and many thousands of Spaniards.
During the first weeks of Lancelot's infatuation for Guenever, it became time for Arthur to cross the Channel to meet his enemy in France--and it was on this war that he decided to carry the young man with him. Lancelot, of course, was not at that time recognized as the chief knight of the Round Table, or he would have been taken in any case. At the present period of his life he had only fought one joust with Arthur himself, and the accepted captain of the knights was Gawaine.
Lancelot was angry at being taken from Guenever, because he felt that it implied a lack of trust. Besides, he knew that Sir Tristram had been left with King Mark's wife of Cornwall on a similar occasion. He did not see why he should not be left with Guenever in the same way.
The Ill-Made Knight T.H. White
There is no need to go into the whole story of the Roman campaign, although it lasted several years. It was the usual sort of war, with a great deal of shoving and shouting on both sides, great strokes smitten, many men overthrown, and great valiances, prowesses, and feats of arms shown every day. It was Bedegraine enlarged--with the same refusal on Arthur's part to regard it as a sporting or commercial enterprise--although it did have its characteristic touches. Redheaded Gawaine lost his temper when sent on an embassy and killed a man in the middle of the negotiations. Sir Lancelot led a terrific battle in which his men were outnumbered by three to one. He slew the King Lyly and three great lords called Alakuke, Herawd, and Heringdale. During the campaign three notorious giants were accounted for-- two of them by Arthur himself. Finally, in the last engagement, Arthur gave the Emperor Lucius such a blow on the head that Excalibur stinted not till it came to his breast, and it was discovered that the Sowdan of Surrie and the King of Egypt and the King of Ethiope--an ancestor of Haile Selassie--together with seventeen other kings of diverse regions and sixty senators of Rome, were among the slain. Arthur put their bodies into sumptuous coffins--not sarcastically--and sent them to the Lord Mayor of Rome, instead of the tribute which had been demanded. This induced the Lord Mayor and nearly the whole of Europe to accept him as overlord. The lands of Pleasance, Pavia, Petersaint, and the Port of Tremble yielded him homage. The feudal convention of battle was broken for good, on the Continent as well as in England.
During this warfare Arthur became genuinely fond of Lancelot, and, by the time they came home, he no longer believed in Merlyn's prophecy at all. He had put it at the back of his mind. Lancelot was acknowledged to be the greatest fighter in the army. Both of them were determined that Guenever could not come between them, and the first few years were safely past.
 What sort of picture do people have of Sir Lancelot from this end of time? Perhaps they only think of him as an ugly young man who was good at games. But he was more than this. He was a knight with a medieval respect for honour.
There is a phrase which you sometimes come across in country districts even nowadays, which sums up a good deal of what he might have tried to say. Farmers use it in Ireland, as praise or compliment, saying, "So-and-so has a Word. He will do what he promised."
Lancelot tried to have a Word. He considered it, as the ignorant country people still consider it, to be the most valuable of possessions.
But the curious thing was that under the king-post of keeping faith with himself and with others, he had a contradictory nature which was far from holy. His Word was valuable to him not only because he was good, but also because he was bad. It is the bad people who need to have principles to restrain them. For one thing, he liked to hurt people. It was for the strange reason that he was cruel, that the poor fellow never killed a man who asked for mercy, or committed a cruel action which he could have prevented. One reason why he fell in love with Guenever was because the first thing he had done was to hurt her. He might never have noticed her as a person, if he had not seen the pain in her eyes.
People have odd reasons for ending up as saints. A man who was not afflicted by ambitions
of decency in his mind might simply have run away with his hero's wife, and then perhaps the tragedy of Arthur would never have happened. An ordinary fellow, who did not spend half his life torturing himself by trying to discover what was right so as to conquer his inclination towards what was wrong, might have cut the knot which brought their ruin.
When the two friends arrived in England from the Roman war, the fleet landed at Sandwich. It was a grey September day, with the blue and copper butterflies flitting in the after-grass, the partridges calling like crickets, the blackberries colouring, and the hazel nuts still nursing their tasteless little kernels in cradles of cotton wool. Queen Guenever was on the beach to meet them, and the first thing Lancelot knew after she had kissed the King, was that she was able to come between them after all. He made a movement as if his entrails were tying thelmselves in knots, saluted the Queen, went off to bed in the nearest inn at once, and lay awake all night. In the morning, he asked leave of absence from the court.
"But you have hardly been at court at all," said Arthur. "Why do you want to go away so soon?"
"I ought to go away."
"Ought to go away?" asked the King. "What do you mean, you ought to go away?"
Lancelot clenched his fist until the knuckles stood out, and said, "I want to go on a quest. I want to find an adventure."
"But, Lance--"
"It is what the Round Table is for, isn't it?" shouted the young man. "The knights are to go on quests, aren't they, to fight against Might? What are you trying to stop me for? It's the whole point of the idea."
"Oh, come," said the King. "You needn't get excited about it. If you want to go, of course you can do whatever you like. I only thought it would be nice to have you with us for a little. Don't be cross, Lance. I don't know what has come over you."
"Come back soon," said the Queen.
This was the beginning of the famous quests. They were not made to win him fame or recreation. They were an attempt to escape from Guenever. They were his struggles to save his honour, not to establish it.
We shall have to describe one of the quests in detail--so as to show the way in which he tried to distract himself, and the way in which this famous honour of his worked. Also it will give a picture of the state of England, which forced King Arthur to work for his theory of justice. It was not that Arthur was a prig--it was that his country of Gramarye lay in such a toil of anarchy in the early days that some idea like the Round Table was needed to make the place survive. The warfare of people like Lot had been suppressed, but not the unbiddable baronage who lived like gangsters on their own estates. Barons were pulling teeth out of Jews to get their money, or roasting bishops who contradicted them. The villeins who belonged to bad
The Ill-Made Knight T.H. White
masters were being basted over slow fires, or sprinkled with molten lead, or impaled, or left to die with their eyes gouged out, or else they were crawling along the roads on hands and knees, because they had been hamstrung. Petty feuds were raging to the destruction of the poor and helpless, and, if a knight did happen to be dragged from his horse in a battle, he was so well screwed up that only an expert could do him harm. Philip Augustus of France, for instance, was dismounted and surrounded at the legendary battle of Bouvines: yet, as the unfortunate infantry were quite unable to puncture him, he was rescued soon after, and continued to fight all the better because he had lost his temper. But the story of Lancelot's first quest must speak for their troubled age of Might in its own way.
There were two knights on the borders of Wales called Sir Carados and Sir Turquine. They were of Celtic stock. These two conservative barons had never yielded to Arthur, and they did not believe in any form of government except the rule of force. They had strong castles and wicked retainers, who found more opportunity for wickedness under their leadership than they would have found in a settled state of society. They existed like eagles, to prey on weaker brethren. It is unfair to compare them with eagles, for many of these birds are noble creatures, while Sir Turquine at any rate was not noble. If he had lived now he might even have been locked in a lunatic hospital, and his friends would certainly have urged him to be psycho-analysed.
One day, when Sir Lancelot had been riding on his adventure for about a month--and all the time going away from where he wanted to be, so that every pace of his horse was a torment-- there appeared a knight in armour riding a great mare, with another bound knight thrown across the saddlebow. The bound knight had fainted. He was bloody and bedraggled, and his head, which hung by the mare's shoulders, had red hair. The riding knight who had captured him was a man of enormous stature, and Lancelot recognized him by his blazon as Sir Carados.
"Who is your prisoner?"
The big knight lifted the prisoner's shield, which was hanging behind him, and showed or, a chevron gules, between three thistles vert.
"What are you doing with Sir Gawaine?"
"Mind your own business," said Sir Carados.
Gawaine must have come to his senses when the mare halted, for his voice now said, coming from upside down: "Is that you, man, Sir Lancelot?"
"What cheer, Gawaine. How stands it with you?"
"Never so hard," said Sir Gawaine, "unless that ye help me, for without ye rescue me, I know nae knight that may."
He was speaking formally in the High Language of Chivalry--for in those days there were two kinds of speech like High and Low Dutch or Norman French and Saxon English.
Lancelot looked at Sir Carados, and said in the vernacular: "Will you put that fellow down, and fight with me instead?"
The Ill-Made Knight T.H. White
"You are a fool," said Sir Carados. "I shall only serve you in the same way."
Then they put Gawaine on the ground, tied up so that he could not get away, and prepared for battle. Sir Carados had a squire to give him his spear, but Lancelot had insisted on leaving Uncle Dap at home. He had to serve himself alone.
The fight was different from the one with Arthur. For one thing, the knights were more evenly matched, and, in the tilt with which it began, neither of them was unhorsed. They broke their ashwood spears to splinters, but both stayed in the saddle, and the horses stood the shock. In the sword-play which followed, Lancelot proved to be the better of the two. After little more than an hour's fighting he managed to give Sir Carados such a buffet on the helm that it pierced his brain-pan--and then, while the dead man was still swaying in the saddle, he caught him by the collar, pulled him under his horse's feet, dismounted in the same instant, and struck off his head. He liberated Sir Gawaine, who thanked him heartily, and rode on again into the wild ways of England, without giving Carados another thought. He fell in with a young cousin of his own, Sir Lionel, and they rode together in search of wrongs to redress. But it was unwise of them to have forgotten Sir Carados.
One day, when they had been riding for some time, they came to a forest during a sultry noon, and Lancelot was so worn out by the struggle inside him about the Queen, and by the weather as weil, that he felt he could not go further. Lionel felt sleepy also, so they decided to lie down under an apple tree in a hedge, after tying their horses to sundry branches. Lancelot went to sleep at once--but the buzzing of the flies kept Sir Lionel awake, and while he was awake a curious sight came by.
The sight was of three knights fully armed, galloping for their lives, with a single knight in pursuit of them. The horses' hoofs thundered on the ground and shook it--so that it was peculiar that Lancelot did not wake up--until, one by one, the huge pursuer ran his quarries down, unhorsed them, and bound them prisoners.
Lionel was an ambitious boy. He thought that he would steal a march on his famous cousin. He got up quietly, put his armour to rights, and rode off to challenge the victor. In less than a minute he too was lying on the ground, trussed so that he could not move, and before Lancelot woke the whole pageant had disappeared. The mysterious, conqueror in these four battles was Sir Turquine, a brother to the Carados whom Lancelot had lately killed. His habit was to take his captives into his grimly castle, where he took off all their clothes and whacked them to his heart's content, as a hobby.
Lancelot was still asleep when a new pageant came prancing by. In the middle of it there was a green silk canopy borne on four spears by four knights gorgeously apparelled. Under the canopy there rode four middle-aged queens on white mules, looking picturesque. They were passing the apple tree, when Lancelot's charger gave a brassy neigh. Queen Morgan le Fay, who was the senior queen of the four--all witches--halted the procession and rode over to Sir Lancelot. He looked dangerous as he lay there in full armour of war, among the long grasses. "It is Sir Lancelot!"
Nothing travels quicker than scandal, especially among supernatural people, so the four queens knew that he was in love with Guenever. They also knew that he was now recognized as the strongest knight in the world. They were jealous of Guenever on this account. They
were delighted by the opportunity which they saw before them. They began to quarrel among thelmselves, about which of them should have him for her magic.
"We need not quarrel," said Morgan le Fay. "I will put an enchantment on him so that he does not wake for six hours. When we have got him safely into my castle, he can choose which of us he will have, himself."
This was done. The sleeping champion was carried on his shield, between two knights, into the Castle Chariot. The castle no longer had its fairy appearance as a castle of food, but its everyday aspect of an ordinary fortress. There he was put into a cold, bare chamber, fast asleep, and left until the enchantment wore off.
When Lancelot woke, he did not know where he was. The room was dark, and seemed to be made of stone like a dungeon. He lay in the dark wondering what would happen next. Later he began to think about Queen Guenever.
The thing which did happen, was that a young damsel came in with his dinner and asked him what cheer?
"How are you, Sir Lancelot?"
"I don't know, fair damsel. I don't know how I got here, so I don't rightly know how I am."
"No need to be frightened," she said. "If you are as great a man as you are supposed to be, I may be able to help you tomorrow morning."
"Thank you. Whether you can help me or not, I should like you to think kindly of me."
So the fair maid went away.
In the morning there was banging of bolts and creaking of rusty locks and several retainers in chain mail came into the dungeon. They lined up on either side of the door, and the magic queens came in behind them, all dressed in their best clothes. Each of the queens made a stately curtsey to Sir Lancelot. He stood up politely and bowed gravely to each of the queens. Morgan le Fay introduced them as the queens of Gore, Northgalis, Eastland, and the Out Isles.
"Now," said Morgan le Fay, "we know about you, so you need not think we don't. You are Sir Lancelot Dulac, and you are having a love affair with Queen Guenever. You are supposed to be the best knight in the world, and that is why the woman is fond of you. Well, that is all over now. We four queens have you in our power, and you have to choose which of us you will have for your mistress. It would be no good unless you choose for yourself, obviously -- but one of us you must have. Which is it to be?"
Lancelot said: "How can I possibly answer a thing like that?"
"You have to answer."
"In the first place," he said, "what you say about me and the King's wife of Britain is untrue. Guenever is the truest lady unto her lord living. If I were free, or had my armour, I would
The Ill-Made Knight T.H. White
fight any champion you liked to put forward, to prove that. And in the second place, I certainly will not have any of you for my mistress. I am sorry if this is discourteous, but it is all I can say."
"Oh!" said Morgan le Fay.
"Yes," said Lancelot
"That is all?"
"Yes."
The four queens curtsied with frigid dignity, and marched out of the room. The sentries made smart about-turns, their mail ringing on the stone floor. The light went out of the door. The door slammed, and the key creaked, and the bolts rumbled into their sockets.
When the fair damsel came in with the next meal, she showed signs of wanting to talk to him. Lancelot noticed that she was a bold creature, who was probably fond of getting her own way.
"You said you might be able to help me?"
The girl looked suspiciously at him and said: "I can help you if you are who you are supposed to be. Are you really Sir Lancelot?"
"I am afraid I am."
"I will help you," she said, "if you will help me."
Then she burst into tears.
While the damsel is weeping, which she did in a charming and determined way, we had better explain about the tournaments which used to take place in Gramarye in the early days. A real tournament was distinct from a joust. In a joust the knights tilted or fenced with each other singly, for a prize. But a tournament was more like a free fight. A body of knights would pick sides, so that there were twenty or thirty on either side, and then they would rush together harum-scarum. These mass battles were considered to be important--for instance, once you had paid your green fee for the tournament, you were admitted on the same ticket to fight in the jousts--but if you had only paid the jousting fee, you were not allowed to fight in the tourney. People were liable to be dangerously injured in the melees. They were not bad things altogether, provided they were properly controlled. Unfortunately, in the early days, they were seldom controlled at all.
Merry England in Pendragon's time was a little like Poor Ould Ireland in O'Connell's. There were factions. The knights of one county, or the inhabitants of one district, or the retainers of one nobleman, might get thelmselves into a state in which they felt a hatred for the faction which lived next door. This hatred would become a feud, and then the king or leader of the one place would challenge the leader of the other one to a tourney--and both factions would go to the meeting with full intent to do each other mischief. It was the same in the days of Papist and Protestant, or Stuart and Orangeman, who would meet together with shillelaghs in
The Ill-Made Knight T.H. White
their hands and murder in their hearts.
"Why are you crying?" asked Sir Lancelot.
"Oh, dear," sobbed the damsel. "That horrid King of Northgalis has challenged my father to a tournament next Tuesday, and he has got three knights of King Arthur's on his side, and my poor father is bound to lose. I am afraid he will get hurt."
"I see. And what is your father's name?"
"He is King Bagdemagus."
Sir Lancelot got up and kissed her politely on the forehead. He saw at once what he was expected to do.
"Very well," he said. "If you can rescue me out of this prison, I will fight in the faction of King Bagdemagus next Tuesday."
"Oh, thank you," said the maiden, wringing out her handkerchief. "Now I must go, I am afraid, or they will miss me downstairs."
Naturally she was not going to help the magic Queen of Northgalis to keep Lancelot in prison--when it was the King of Northgalis himself who was going to fight her father.
In the morning, before the people of the castle had got up, Lancelot heard the heavy door opening quietly. A soft hand was put in his, and he was led out in the darkness. They went through twelve magic doors, until they reached the armoury, and there was all his armour bright and ready. When he had put it on, they went to the stables, and there was his charger scratching on the cobbles with a sparkling shoe.
"Remember."
"Of course," he said. And he rode out over the drawbridge into the morning light
While they had crept through the corridors of Castle Chariot, they had made a plan about meeting King Bagdemagus. Lancelot was to ride to an abbey of white friars which was situated near by, and there he was to meet the damsel--who would, of course, be forced to flee from Queen Morgan because of her treachery in letting him escape. At this abbey they were to wait until King Bagdemagus could be brought over, and then the arrangements for the tournament were to be made. Unfortunately, the Castle Chariot was in the Forest Sauvage, and Lancelot now lost his way to the abbey. He and his horse wandered about all day, bumping against branches, getting tangled in blackberry bushes, and rapidly losing their tempers. In the evening they stumbled on a pavilion of red sendal, with nobody inside.
He got off his horse and looked at the pavilion. There was something queer about it-- luxurious as it was in the rooky wood, and without anybody in sight.
"This is a strange pavilion," he thought sadly, for his mind was full of Guenever, "but I suppose I may as well stay in it for the night. Either it is here for some adventure or other, in which case I ought to try the adventure, or else the owners have gone away on holiday, and in
that case they will not mind my taking shelter for one evening. Anyway, I am lost, and there is nothing else I can do."
He unharnessed the horse and spancelled him. Then he took off his own armour and hung it neatly on a nearby tree with the shield on top. After this he ate some bread which the girl had given him, drinking water from a stream which ran beside the pavilion, stretched his arms out until the elbows went click, yawned, hit his front teeth with his fist three times, and went to bed. The bed was a sumptuous one with a coverlet of red sendal, to match the tent. Lancelot rolled himself in it, pressed his nose into the silk pillow, kissed it for Guenever, and was fast asleep.
It was moonlight when he woke, and a naked man was sitting on his left foot, trimming bis finger-nails.
Lancelot, who had been woken from his love sleep with a start, moved suddenly in the bed when he felt the man. The man, equally surprised at feeling a movement, jumped up and snatched his sword. Lancelot jumped out on the other side of the bed and ran for his own arms, where they were hanging in the tree. The man came after him, waving his blade and trying to get a cut at him from behind. Lancelot reached the tree in safety and swung round with his weapon in his hand. They looked strange and terrible in the moonlight, both stark naked, with their silver steel glancing under the harvest moon.
"Now," cried the man, and he aimed a furious swipe at Lancelot's legs. The next minute he had dropped his sword and was holding his stomach with both hands, doubled up and whistling. The cut which Lancelot had given welled over with blood which looked black in the moonlight, and you could see some of the insides of the stomach with their secret life laid open.
"Don't hit me," cried the man. "Mercy. Don't hit me again. You have killed me."
"I am sorry," said Lancelot. "You did not even wait till I had a sword."
The man went on wailing: "Mercy! Mercy!"
Lancelot stuck his blade in the ground and went over to examine the wound.
"I am not going to hurt you," he said. "It's all right Let me see."
"You have cut open my liver," said the man accusingly.
"Well, I can't do more than say I am sorry, even if I have. I don't know what we were fighting about anyway. Lean on my shoulder and we will get you into bed."
When he had got the man to bed, and stopped his bleeding, and discovered that the wound was not a mortal one, a beautiful lady appeared in the opening of the tent They had lit a rush light, so that she saw what had happened in a flash, and immediately she began screaming at the top of her voice. She rushed over to comfort the wounded man, and accused Lancelot of being a murderer, and carried on a great deal.
"Do stop howling," said the man. "He is not a murderer. We just made a mistake."
"I was in bed," said Lancelot, "when he came and sat on me, and we were both so startled that we had a fight I am sorry that I hurt him.
"But it was our bed," cried the lady, like one of the Three Bears. "What were you doing in our bed?"
"Really," he said, "I am sorry. There was nobody in the pavilion when I found it, and I was lost and tired, so I thought it would not matter if I took a night's lodging."
"Nor did it matter," said the man. "You are welcome to a night's lodging, and I don't think the wound is going to be a bad one after all. May I inquire your name?"
"Lancelot."
"Well!" exclaimed the man. "There now, my dear, look who I have been fighting. No wonder I got a bit of a chip. I was wondering why my life was spared so easily."
So they insisted that Lancelot should stay the night, and in the morning they put him on the correct road for the abbey of white friars.
Nothing much came of this encounter in the main story, except that the knight, whose name was Belleus, was introduced to the Round Table by Lancelot as soon as he was well again. He was the kind of generous fellow that Arthur needed, and Lancelot tried to make up for the trouble which he had caused by getting him a seat at the Table.
At the abbey of white friars the fair damsel was waiting in a state of excitement. She was afraid that he might have let her down. His horse's hoofs, however, had no sooner clattered on the cobbles than she came flying from her tower room to welcome him with delight.
"Father will be here this evening," she cried. "Oh, I am so glad you came! I was afraid you might have forgotten."
Lancelot's twisted mouth grinned at the word she had chosen to use. Then he changed into civilian dress, had a bath, and waited for King Bagdemagus.
"It is a puzzling life in Gramarye," he said to himself, trying to keep his mind off the young Queen. "Things happen so quickly. One hardly knows where one is half the time, and there is that cousin of mine who vanished under the apple tree, who has still to be accounted for. What with magic queens and faction tournaments and people getting into bed with you at night, and half the family vanishing without trace, it is difficult to keep in line."
Then he brushed his hair, smoothed his gown, and went down to meet King Bagdemagus.
There is no need to give a long description of the tourney. Malory gives it. Lancelot picked three knights who were recommended by the young damsel to go with him, and he arranged that all four of them should bear the vergescu. This was the white shield carried by unfledged knights, and Lancelot insisted on this arrangement because he knew that three of his own brethren of the Round Table were going to fight on the other side. He did not want them to recognize him, because it might cause ill-feeling at court. On the other hand, he felt that it
The Ill-Made Knight 25 T.H. White
was his duty to fight against them because of the promise which he had given to the damsel. The King of Northgalis, who was the leader of the opposite side, had one hundred and sixty knights in his faction, and King Bagdemagus only had eighty. Lancelot went for the first knight of the Round Table, and put his shoulder out of joint. He went for the second one so hard that the unlucky fellow was carried over his horse's tail and buried his helm several inches in the ground. He hit the third knight on the head so hard that his nose bled, and his horse ran away with him. By the time he had broken the thigh of the King of Northgalis, everybody could see that to all intents and purposes the tournament was over.
The next thing that happened was that our hero set out to discover what had become of Lionel. He was free to do so, for the first time--for, since the disappearance of his cousin, he had either been imprisoned by the malignant queens or else he had been discharging his obligations to the girl who had rescued him from them. King Bagdemagus got the prize at the tournament before he left, and the damsel was almost tearfully grateful. Everybody said that they would be friends for ever, and that they had only to send each other word if there was anything that anybody could do for anybody in return. Then Lancelot mounted his horse, got his bearings by asking several peasants where he was, and rode off toward the forest of the apple tree where he had lost his cousin. He thought that by making an all-round-the-hat cast at the place where he had last seen his cousin, he might be able to pick up the scent once more, although it was cold.
In the forest of the apple tree, indeed at the very foot of the tree itself, he came across a lady riding a white palfrey. The tree was thought to be a magic one, which was the reason why such a lot of traffic went on round it.
"Lady," said he, "do you know of any adventures in this forest?"
"Plenty," she said, "if you are man enough to take them on."
"I could try."
"You look a strong man," said the lady. "You have a bold look, too, in spite of your ears which stick out so frightfully. If you like, I will take you where the fiercest baron in the world lives, but he is sure to kill you."
"Never mind."
"I will only take you if you tell me your name. It would be murder to take you unless you are a famous knight."
"My name is Lancelot."
"I thought it was," said the lady. "Well, it is lucky it is.
According to the things which people are saying about you, you are probably the only knight in the world who can beat the man I am taking you to. His name is Sir Turquine."
"Good."
"Some say he is a madman. He has sixty-four knights in prison, whom he has captured in
The Ill-Made Knight 26 T.H. White
single combat, and he spends the time beating them with thorns. If he captures you, he will beat you too, all naked."
"He sounds an exciting man to fight."
"It is a sort of concentration camp."
"That is what I have been getting ready for," said Sir Lancelot "It is what Arthur invented the Round Table to prevent."
"If I take you to him, you must promise to do something for me afterwards--that is, if you win."
"What sort of thing?" he asked cautiously.
"You need not be afraid," said the lady. "It is only to vanquish another knight I know of, who is distressing some damsels."
"I will promise that gladly."
"Well," said the lady, "God, He knows how you will get on. Anyway, I will say a prayer for you while you are fighting."
When they had been riding for some time, they came to a ford like the one at which he had fought the first fight with King Arthur. On the trees round the ford there were hanging rusty helms and melancholy shields--sixty-four of them, with their bends and chevrons and luces hauriant and merles and eagles displayed and lions passant guardant looking desolate and abandoned. The leather of their guiges was green and mildewy. It looked like a gamekeeper's gallows.
In the middle of the glade, on the chief tree, there hung an enormous copper basin, triumphing over the beaten shields. The latest shield under it was Lionel's--argent, a bend gules distinguished with some sort of label of cadency.
Lancelot knew what he had to do with this basin, and he did it. He put his helm in position, rode through the dripping leaves to the basin, and beat on it with the butt of his spear until the
bottom fell out. Then he and the lady stood still in the forest, which was as if it had been shocked silent by the hideous noise.
Nobody came.
"His castle is beyond," said the lady. They went to the castle gates in silence, and rode up and down in front of them for half an hour. He took off his helm and gauntlets, and frowned, and bit his finger-nails from anxiety.
After the half-hour was over, a gigantic knight came riding through the forest. He looked so like Sir Carados-- the knight who had been slain at the rescue of Gawaine-- that Lancelot was startled. Not only was he of the same build, but he also had a bound knight thrown across the saddlebow of his mare. Most peculiar of all, the bound knight's shield carried the three
The Ill-Made Knight 27 T.H. White
thistles and the chevron, with a red canton. In fact, the second of the big knights had captured Gaheris--Gawaine's brother. Lancelot watched him with a critical eye.
It may not be amiss to mention that a good judge of style could often recognize a knight in armour, even if he was disguised and bearing the vergescu. In later life Lancelot sometimes had to fight disguised, because otherwise nobody would fight him. Yet Arthur and others generally guessed him by his riding. People nowadays can recognize cricketers, even when their faces are too far away to be seen, and so it was then.
Lancelot was a good judge of style, because of his long practice. As soon as he had watched Sir Turquine for a moment or two, he noticed that there was a slight weakness in his seat. He remarked to the lady that unless Turquine sat better, he thought he would be able to rescue the prisoners. As it turned out, Turquine did sit better when it came to the tilt, so that this particular criticism came to nothing--but it throws a sidelight on jousting and may have been worth mentioning.
The riding was the whole thing. If a man had the courage to throw himself into the fullest gallop at the moment of impact, he generally won. Most men faltered a little, so that they were not at their best momentum. This was why Lancelot constantly gained his tilts. He had what Uncle Dap called the elan. Sometimes, when he was in disguise, he would ride clumsily on purpose, showing daylight at his seat. But at the last moment there was always the true dash--so that the onlookers, and frequently his wretched opponent, could exclaim, "Ah, Lancelot!" even before the lance drove home.
"Fair knight," he said, "put down that wounded man and let him test a little. Then we two can prove our strengths."
Sir Turquine rode up to him, and said through his teeth; "If you are a knight of the Round Table, it will give me great pleasure to knock you down first and whack you afterwards. I could do that to you, and your whole table with you."
"It seems a tall order."
Then they retreated in the usual way, fewtered their spears, and charged together like thunder. Lancelot, at the last moment, noticed that he was wrong about Turquine's seat. In the last flash he realized that Turquine was the finest tiller he had met, that he was coming with a hurl as great as his own, and that his aim was sure.
The knights ducked and drew thelmselves together; the spears struck at the same moment; the horses, checked in mid-career, reared up and fell over backward; the spears burst and went sailing high in the air, turning over and over gracefully like the results of high explosive; and the lady on the palfrey looked away. When she looked again, both horses were down with their backs broken, and the knights lay still.
Two hours later, Lancelot and Turquine were still fighting with their swords.
"Stop," said Turquine. "I want to speak to you."
Lancelot stopped.
The Ill-Made Knight 28 T.H. White
"Who are you?" asked Sir Turquine. "You are the finest knight I ever fought with. I never saw a man with such good wind. Listen, I have sixty-four prisoners in my castle, and I have killed or maimed hundreds of others, but none were as good as you. If you will have peace, and be my friend, I will loose my prisoners."
"It is kind of you."
"I will do this for you, if you are anybody except one person. If you are he, I must fight you to the death."
"Who is this person?"
"Lancelot," said Sir Turquine. "If you are Lancelot, I must never yield or make friends. He killed my brother Carados."
"I am that man."
Sir Turquine made a hissing through his helm and struck craftily, before his enemy was ready.
"Ah, would you?" said Lancelot "I only had to pretend I was not myself, and I could have had the prisoners safe. But you try to kill me without warning."
Sir Turquine continued to hiss.
"I am sorry about Carados," said Lancelot "He was killed in fair fight and never offered to yield. I never had him at mercy. He was killed in the middle of the fight"
They fought for two more hours. The blade was not the only weapon used by knights in armour. Sometimes they struck each other with the edges of their shields, sometimes they clubbed each other with the pommels of their swords. The grass all round was speckled with their blood--little spots like those on trout, but with a kind of tail on each spot, like a tadpole. Sometimes, because of their weight, they fell over each other. The heavy, straw-stuffed helms of chivalry had such small holes to breathe through that they felt like suffocating. Their shields hung wearily, not covering them properly.
It was over in a second. Neither of them spoke. Lancelot dropped his sword at a moment of opportunity and caught Turquine by the snout of his helm. They fell over, and the helm came off. They drew their misericordes for the close work. Turquine bounced and shuddered and was dead.
Later, while Gaheris and the lady were giving him some water, Lancelot said:- "Whatever was wrong with him, he was game. I am sorry he would not yield."
"But think of the maimed knights and the beating."
"He was the old school," he said. "It is what we have to stop. But he was a credit to the old school as a fighter, all the same."
"He was a brute," said the lady.
The Ill-Made Knight 29 T.H. White
"Whatever he was, he was fond of his brother. Look Gaheris, will you lend me your horse? I want to go on, and my own is dead, poor creature. If you could lend me yours, you could go forward and let Lionel and the others out of the castle. Tell Lionel to go back to court and not to be a silly fellow. I have to ride with this lady. Will you do that?"
"You can have my horse, certainly," said Gaheris. "You have saved him and me as well. How you keep on saving the Orkneys! Last time it was Gawaine. And Agravaine is in that castle at this minute. Of course you can have my horse, Lancelot, of course you can."
8 Lancelot had several other adventures during his first quest--it lasted a year--but perhaps only two are worth repeating in detail. They were both mixed up with the conservative ethics of Force Majeur against which the King had started his crusade. It was the old school, the Norman baronial attitude, which provided the adventures at this period--for few people can hate so bitterly and so self-righteously as the members of a ruling caste which is being dispossessed. The knights of the Round Table were sent out as a measure against Fort Mayne, and the choleric barons who lived by Fort Mayne took up the cudgels with the ferocity of despair. They would have written to The Times about it, if there had been such a paper. The best of them convinced thelmselves that Arthur was newfangled, and that his knights were degenerate from the standards of their fathers. The worst of them made up uglier names than Bolshevist even, and allowed the brutal side of their natures to dwell on imaginary enormities which they attributed to the knights. The situation became divorced from common sense, so that atrocity stories were accepted by the atrocious people. Many of the barons whom Lancelot had to put down had worked thelmselves into such a state about him, through fear of losing their ancient powers, that they believed him to be a sort of poison-gas man. They fought him with as much unscrupulousness and hatred as if he had been an antichrist, and they truly believed thelmselves to be defending the right It became a civil war of ideologies.
One day in the fine summer, he was riding through the park land of a castle which was strange to him. The trees grew dispersedly about the sward--great elms and oaks and beeches--and Lancelot was thinking about Guenever with a heavy heart. Before he had parted from the lady who led him to Sir Turquine--and he had done the thing for her which he had promised--they had started a conversation about marriage, which had upset him. The lady had said that he ought either to have a wife or a mistress, and Lancelot had been angry. "I can't stop people from saying things if they want to," he had said, "but circumstances make it impossible for me to marry, while I consider that having a mistress is no good." They argued about it for some time, and then parted. Now, although he had passed several adventures in between, he was still thinking of the lady's advice and feeling wretched.
There was the sound of bells in the air--and he looked up immediately.
A fine peregrine falcon, with her music jingling in the whistling wind als clear, and her creance trailing behind her, was beating along above his head toward the top of one of the elms. She was in a temper. As soon as she reached the top of the elm she sat down in it, looking about her with raging eye and panting beak. The creance wrapped itself three times round the nearest bough. When she noticed Sir Lancelot riding toward her, she tried to fly away again in fury. The creance caught her. She hung upside down, bating with her wings. His heart came into his mouth for fear that she would break some feathers. In a few moments she ceased to flap, and hung upside down, revolving slowly, looking ignoble and indignant
The Ill-Made Knight 30 T.H. White
and ridiculous, holding her head the right way up like a snake's.
"Oh, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lancelot!" cried an unknown gentlewoman, riding toward him at full speed and evidently trying to wring her hands in spite of the reins. "Oh, Sir Lancelot! I have lost my falcon."
"There she is," he said, "in that tree."
"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!" cried the lady. "I was only trying to call her in cranes and the string broke! My husband will kill me if I do not catch her again. He is so hasty and such a keen falconer."
"But surely he will not kill you?"
"Oh, he will! He will not mean it, but he will do it! He is such a hasty man."
"Perhaps I could stop him?"
"Oh, no," said the gentlewoman. "That would not do at all. You might hurt him. I would not like you to hurt my dear husband. Don't you think you could climb up the tree and catch the hawk instead?"
Lancelot looked at the gentlewoman and at the tree. Then he heaved a deep sigh and remarked, as Malory reports him: "Well, fair lady, since that ye know my name, and require me of my knighthood to help you, I will do what I may to get your hawk; and yet truly I am an ill climber, and the tree is passing high, and few boughs to help me withal."
He had spent his childhood learning to be a fighter. It had left him no time for birds'-nesting like other boys. The lady's request, which would have given no trouble to people brought up like Arthur or Gawaine, really was an upset for him.
Lancelot took off his armour sadly, with an occasional crooked glance at the horrible tree, until he was dressed in his shirt and breeches. Then he assaulted the first boughs manfully, while the gentlewoman ran about underneath, talking about hawks and husbands and the nice weather they were having.
"All right," he said, with his eyes full of bark and a hideous scowl on his face. "All right All right"
At the top of the tree, the falcon was in such a tangle with her creance--she had wound it round her neck and wings, as usual, and was under the impression that it was assaulting her-- that Lancelot had to let her stand on the bare hand. This she gripped with the fury of hysteria, but he patiently disentangled her without minding the stabs. Falconers seldom fuss when their hawks hurt them. They are too interested.
When the hawk was safely rescued from the branches, he realized that he would not be able to climb down again with one hand. He shouted to the lady, who seemed small at the foot of the tree: "Look out, I am going to tie her jesses to a heavy branch, if I can break one off, and then throw her down. I will get one that is not too heavy, so that she comes gently. I shall have to throw her out a bit, so that she is clear of the boughs."
The Ill-Made Knight 31 T.H. White
"Oh, do be careful!" cried the lady.
When Lancelot had done what he said, he began to make his way down again with care. There were some bad bits on the way, where he had to rely on balance alone. He was about twenty feet from the ground when a fat knight in full armour came galloping up.
"Ha, Sir LancelotI" shouted the fat knight "Now I have you where I want you."
The lady picked up the falcon and began to go away.
"Lady!" said Lancelot, wondering how everybody came to know his name.
The fat man screamed out: "You leave her alone, you assassin. That is my wife, that is. She has only been doing what I told her. It was a trick. Ha! Ha! Now I have got you without any of your famous armour on, and I am going to kill you, like drowning a kitten."
"It is not very knightly," said Lancelot, with a grimace. "You might at least let me arm and fight fair."
"Let you arm, you puppy! Whatever do you take me for? I don't want any of this newfangled nonsense. When I catch a man who eats human children roasted, I kill him like the vermin he is."
"But really--"
"Come down, come down! I can't wait about all day. Come down and take your medicine like a man, if you are a man."
"I assure you that I do not roast children."
The fat knight grew quite purple in the face and shouted: "Liar! Liar! Devil! Come down at once."
Lancelot sat on a branch and dangled his feet and bit his fingernails.
"Do you mean to say," he asked, "that you loosed that falcon on purpose, with her cranes on, so as to be able to murder me when I was naked?"
"Come down!"
"If I come down, I shall do my best to kill you."
"Buffoon!" cried the fat knight.
"Well," said Lancleot, "it is your own fault. You should not play dirty tricks. For the last time, will you let me arm like a gentleman?"
"Certainly not."
Lancelot broke off a bough of rotten wood, and jumped down on the other side of his horse, so that the horse was between them. The fat knight rode at him, and tried to swipe off his head, leaning across the horse between. Lancelot parried the stroke with his bough, and the knight's sword stuck in the wood. Then he took the sword away from its owner and slit his throat.
"Go away," said Lancelot to the gentlewoman. "Stop howling. Your husband was a fool and you are a bore. I am not sorry I killed him."
But he was sorry.
The last adventure was also concerned with treachery and a lady. The young man was riding mournfully through the fen country--which had not been drained in those days and was probably the wildest part of England. It was all secret ways through the marshes, which were known only to the Saxon marsh men who had been conquered by Uther Pendragon, and the whole sea-smelling plain was one vast quack under the low sky. The bitterns boomed and the marsh harriers skimmed over the reeds and millions of widgeon and mallard and tufted ducks flew about in various wedges, looking like champagne bottles balanced on a nimbus of wings. On the salt marshes the geese from Spitzbergen walked and nibbled, with their necks bent into their peculiar loop, and the fen men stalked them with nets and engines. The fen people had spotted bellies and their toes were webbed--at any rate that was the belief in the rest of England. They generally killed foreigners.
While Lancelot was riding along a straight road which seemed to lead nowhere, he saw two people galloping towards him from the other end. They turned out to be a knight and his lady. The lady was in front, going like mad, and the knight was after her. His sword flashed against the dull sky.
"Here! Here!" cried Lancelot, riding at them.
"Help!" screamed the lady. "Oh, save me! He is trying to cut my head off."
"Leave her alone! Get out!" shouted the knight "She is my wife, and she has been committing adultery!"
"I never did," wailed the lady. "Oh, sir, save me from him. He is a cruel, beastly brute. Just because I am fond of my cousin german, he is jealous. Why should I not be fond of my cousin german?"
"Scarlet woman!" exclaimed the knight, and he tried to get at her.
Lancelot rode between them and said: "Really, you must not go for a woman like that. I don't care whose fault it is, but you can't kill women."
"Since when?"
"Since King Arthur was king."
"She is my wife," said the knight "She is nothing to do with you. Get out! And she is an adulteress, whatever she says."
"Oh no, I am not," said the lady. "But you are a bully. And you drink."
"Who made me drink, then? And, besides, it is no worse to drink than be an adulteress."
"Be quiet," said Lancelot, "both of you. This is a nuisance. I shall have to ride between you until you cool off. I suppose you would not care to have a fight with me, sir, instead of killing this lady?"
"Certainly not," said the knight. "I know by your argent, a bend gules, that you are Lancelot; and I would not be such a fool as to fight you, especially for a bitch like this. What the devil has it got to do with you?"
"I will go," said Lancelot, "as soon as you promise on your knighthood not to kill women."
"Well, I won't promise."
"You wouldn't," said the lady. "Anyway, you would not keep your promise, if you did."
"There are some marsh soldiers," said the knight, "cantering after us. Look behind. They are armed cap-a-pie."
Lancelot reined his horse and looked over his shoulder. At the same moment the knight leaned over to his near side and swapped off the lady's head. When Lancelot looked back again, without seeing any soldiers, he found the lady sitting beside him with no head on. She slowly began to sag to the left, throbbing horribly, and fell in the dust. There was blood all over his horse.
Lancelot grew white about the nostrils.
He said, "I shall kill you for that."
The knight immediately jumped off his horse and lay on the ground.
"Don't kill me!" he said. "Mercy! She was an adulteress."
Lancelot dismounted also and drew his sword.
"Get up," he said. "Get up and fight, you, you--"
The knight scrambled along the ground toward him, and threw his arms round his thighs. By being close to the avenger, he made it difficult for him to swing the sword. "Mercy!" His abjection made Lancelot feel horrible.
"Get up," he said. "Get up and fight. Look, I will take my armour off and fight you with my sword only."
But "Mercy, mercy!" was all the knight would say.
Lancelot began to shudder, not at the knight but at the cruelty in himself. He held his sword
loathingly, and pushed the knight away.
"Look at all the blood," he said.
"Don't kill me," said the knight. "I yield. I yield. You can't kill a man at mercy."
Lancelot put up his sword and went back from the knight, as if he were going back from his own soul. He felt in his heart cruelty and cowardice, the things which made him brave and kind.
"Get up," he said. "I won't hurt you. Get up, go." The knight looked at him, on all fours like a dog, and stood up, crouching uncertainly. Lancelot went away and was sick.
At the feast of Pentecost it was customary for the knights who had been on Table quests to gather again at Carlion so as to relate their adventures. Arthur had found that this made people keener on fighting in the new way of Right, if they had to tell about it afterwards. Most of them preferred to bring their prisoners with them, as witnesses to their stories. It was as if some Inspector General of Police in a very distant part of Africa were to send out his superintendents into the jungle, asking them to come back next Christmas with all the savage chiefs whom they had brought to righteousness. For one thing, it impressed the savage chiefs to see the great court, and they often went home reformed.
The Pentecost next after Lancelot's first quest was almost a fiasco. A few seedy giants of the Strong Arm, who had been captured by the Orkney faction, turned up and said their homage, but the Lancelot contingent was a spate. "Whose man are you?" "Lancelot's." "And whose are you, my good fellow?" "Lancelot's." After a bit the whole Table began shouting the answers. Arthur would say: "You are welcome to Carlion, Sir Belleus, and may I ask which of my knights you have yielded to?" "Lancelot," the Table would shout in chorus. And Sir Belleus, blushing rather and wondering whether the laughter was at him, would say in a small voice: "Yes, I yielded to Sir Lancelot."
Sir Bedivere came and admitted how he had swapped off his adulterous wife's head. He had brought it with him, and was told to take it to the Pope as a penance--he became very holy after that. Gawaine came gruffly and told in Scottish English how he had been rescued from Sir Carados. Gaheris, at the head of a deputation of sixty-four knights with rusty shields, related his rescue from Sir Turquine. The daughter of King Bagdemagus arrived in an enthusiastic state and told about the tournament with the King of Northgalis. Besides these, there were many people from adventures which we have left out--mainly knights who had yielded to Sir Lancelot when he was disguised as Sir Kay.
You may remember from the first book that Kay was inclined to throw his tongue a bit too much, and he had got himself unpopular on account of this. Lancelot had been compelled during the quest to rescue him from three knights who were pursuing him. Then, so that Kay could get home to court unmolested, Lancelot had changed armour with him one night while he was asleep--and thereafter the knights who went for Lancelot under the impression that he was Kay had gotten the surprise of their lives, while the knights who met Kay in Lancelot's armour had given him a wide berth. Knights yielded under this category included Gawaine, Uwaine, Sagramour, Ector de Maris, and three others. Also there came a knight called Sir Meliot de Logres, who had been rescued under supernatural circumstances.
All these people gave thelmselves up, not to King Arthur, but to Guenever. Lancelot had kept himself away for a whole year, but there was a limit to his endurance. Thinking of her all the time and longing to be back with her, he had allowed himself this one indulgence. He had sent his captives to kneel at her feet It was a fatal course of action.
9 It is difficult to explain about Guenever, unless it it is possible to love two people at the same time. Probably it is not possible to love two people in the same way, but there are different kinds of love. Women love their children and their husbands at the same time--and men often feel a lusty thought for one woman while they are feeling a love of the heart for another. In some way such as this Guenever did come to love the Frenchman without losing her affection for Arthur. She and Lancelot were hardly more than children when it began, and the King was about eight years their senior. At twenty-two, the age of thirty seems to be the verge of senility. The marriage between her and Arthur had been what they call a "made" marriage. That is to say, it had been fixed by treaty with King Leodegrance, without consulting her. It had been a successful union, as "made" marriages generally are, and before Lancelot came on the scene the young girl had adored her famous husband, even if he was so old. She had felt respect for him, with gratitude, kindness, love, and a sense of protection. She had felt more than this--you might say that she had felt everything except the passion of romance.
And then the captives arrived. A blushing queen of little more than twenty summers on her throne, and the whole flame-lit hall filling with noble knights on bended knee. "Whose prisoner are you?" "I am the Queen's prisoner, to live or die, sent by Sir Lancelot." "Whose you?" "The Queen's, by Lancelot's arm." Sir Lancelot--the name on everybody's lips: the best knight in the world, top of the averages, even above Tristram: the courtly, the merciful, the ugly, the invincible: and he had sent them all to her. It was like a birthday party, so many presents. It was like the story books.
Guenever sat straight and bowed royally to her prisoners. She pardoned them all. Her eyes were brighter than her crown.
Lancelot came last. There was a stir among the torch-bearers near the door, and a sound went round the hall. The clatter of knives and plates and tankards, the noise of friendly shouting which had sounded a moment before like a meeting of seabirds on St. Kilda, the yells for more mutton or a pint of mead were stilled--and the blurs of white faces turned toward the door. There was Lancelot, no longer in armour but dressed in a magnificent velvet robe, scalloped and diapered. He hesitated in the dark frame, hideous and friendly, wondering why the silence was--and the lights showed him up. Then the faces turned back again, the seabird meeting started once more, and Lancelot came forward to kiss the King's hand.
It was the moment. Perhaps it is better than trying to explain.
"Well, Lance," said Arthur cheerfully, "these are some high jinks, and no mistake about it. Jenny can hardly sit still, with all her captives."
"They were for her," said Lancelot. The Queen and he did not look at each other. They had done so with the click of two magnets coming together, the moment that he crossed the threshold.
"I can't help thinking they were for me too," said the King. "The result ought to be that you have made me a present of about three counties."
Lancelot felt a need to prevent silence. He began talking too quickly.
"Three counties is not much," he said, "for the Emperor of all Europe. You speak as if you had never conquered the Dictator of Rome. How are your dominions getting on?"
"They are getting on as you make them, Lance. It was no good conquering the Dictator, unless you and the others do the civilizing part. What is the use of being the Emperor of Europe, if the whole place is fighting mad?"
Guenever supported her hero in the effort against silence. It was their first partnership.
"You are a strange man," she said, "Arthur dear. You fight all the time, and conquer countries and win battles, and then you say that fighting is a bad thing."
"So it is a bad thing. It is the worst thing in the world. Oh, God, we needn't explain it again."
"No."
"How is the Orkney faction?" asked the younger man hastily. "How is your famous civilization going? Might for Right? You mustn't forget I have been away a year."
The King put his head in his hands and looked miserably at the table between his elbows. He was a kind, conscientious, peace-loving fellow, who had been afflicted in his youth by a tutor of genius. Between the two of them they had worked out their theory that killing people, and being a tyrant over them, was wrong. To stop this sort of thing, they had invented the idea of the Table--a vague idea like democracy, or sportsmanship, or morals--and now, in the effort to impose a world of peace, he found himself up to the elbows in blood. When he was feeling healthy he did not grieve much, because he knew the dilemma was inevitable--but in weak moments he was persecuted by shame and indecision. He was one of the first Nordic men who had invented civilization, or who had desired to do otherwise than Attila the Hun had done, and the battle against chaos sometimes did not seem to be worth fighting. He often thought that it might have been better for all his dead soldiers to be alive--even if they had lived under tyranny and madness--rather than be quite dead.
"The Orkney faction is bad," he said. "So is civilization, except for the bit which you have just brought in. Before you came, I was thinking that I was the Emperor of nothing--now I feel as if I were the Emperor of three counties."
"What is wrong with the Orkney faction?" "Oh, God, must we talk about it when we were feeling happy because you had come back? I suppose we must." "It is Morgause," said the Queen. "Partly. Morgause is having love affairs with anybody she can get hold of, now that Lot is dead. How I wish King Pellinore had not had that unfortunate accident when he killed him! It is having a bad effect on her children." "How do you mean?"
The King scratched on the table and stated: "I wish you had not conquered Gawaine, that time when you were disguised as Kay. I almost wish you had not made such brilliant successes in rescuing him and his brothers from Carados and Turquine." "Why not?
"This Round Table," said the older man slowly, "was a good thing when we thought of it. It was necessary to invent a way for the fighting men to express thelmselves without doing harm. I can't see how we could have done it otherwise than by starting a fashion, like children. To get them in, we had to have a gang, as kids have in schools. Then the gang had to swear a darksome oath that they would only fight for our ideas. You could call it for civilization. What I meant by civilization when I invented it, was simply that people ought not to take advantage of weakness--not violate maidens, and rob widows, and kill a man when he was down. People ought to be civil. But it has turned into sportsmanship. Merlin always said that sportsmanship was the curse of the world, and so it is. My scheme is going wrong. All these knights now are making a fetish of it. They are turning it into a competitive thing. Merlin used to call it Games-Mania. Everybody gossips and nags and hints and speculates about who unseated whom last, and who has rescued most virgins, and who is the best knight of the Table. I made it a round table to prevent that very thing, but it has not prevented it The Orkney faction have got the craze worst. I suppose their sense of insecurity over their mother makes it necessary for them to be sure of a safe place at the top of the list. They have to excel, to make up for her. That is why I wish you had not beaten Gawaine. He is a decent chap, but he will hold it against you inside himself. You have hurt him in his tilting average--it is a part of their make-up which has now become more important to my knights than their souls. If you are not careful, you will have the Orkney faction after your blood, as well as after poor Pellinore's. It's a foul position. People will do the basest things on account of their so-called honour. I wish I had never invented honour, or sportsmanship, or civilization."
"What a speech!" said Lancelot. "Cheer up. The faction won't hurt me, even if it does come after my blood. As for your scheme going wrong, that is nonsense. The Round Table is the best thing that ever happened."
Arthur, whose head was still in his hands, raised his eyes. He saw that his friend and his wife were looking at each other with the wide pupils of madness, so he quickly attended to his plate.
10 Uncle Dap said, turning the helm round in his hands: "Your mantling is cut and torn. We shall have to get another. It is honourable to have the mantling slashed, but dishonourable to keep it so when there is an opportunity to replace it. Such a course of action would be boastful."
They were talking in a little closet with a north window, cold and grey, and the blue light lay like frozen oil upon the steel.
"Yes."
"How did Joyeux go? Is he sharp still? Did you like his balance?"
Joyeux had been made by Galand, the greatest sword-smith of the Middle Ages.
"Yes."
"Yes! Yes!" cried Uncle Dap. "Can you say nothing but Yes? Death of my soul, Lancelot, but one asks if you are dumb! What in the world is this that has come over you, in the end?"
Lancelot had been smoothing the panache of feathers which was used as a distinguishing mark on the helm in
Uncle Dap's hands. It was detachable. People have got it into their heads, through the cinema and the comic advertisements, that knights in armour generally wore ostrich plumes, nodding like stalks of pampas grass. This was not the case. Kay's panache, for instance, was shaped like a rigid, flat fan, with its edges pointing fore and aft. It was carefully arranged out of the eyes of peacock feathers, exactly as if a stiff peacock fan had been erected endwise on his head. It was not a tuft of plumes, and it did not nod. It was rather like the adipose fin of a fish, but gaudy. Lancelot, who did not care for gaudy things, wore a few heron's hackles bound with silver thread, which suited the argent of his shield. He had been stroking them. Now he threw them violently into a corner and stood up. He began walking the narrow room in a jerky way.
"Uncle Dap," he said, "do you remember how I asked you not to talk about something?"
"I do."
"Is Guenever in love with me?"
"You should ask her," replied his uncle, with French logic.
"What must I do?" he cried. "What must I do?"
If it is difficult to explain about Guenever's love for two men at the same time, it is almost impossible to explain about Lancelot. At least it would be impossible nowadays, when everybody is so free from superstitions and prejudice that it is only necessary for all of us to do as we please. Why did not Lancelot make love to Guenever, or run away with his hero's wife altogether, as any enlightened man would do today?
One reason for his dilemma was that he was a Christian. The modern world is apt to forget that several people were Christians in the remote past, and in Lancelot's time there were no Protestants--except John Scotus Erigena. His Church, in which he had been brought up--and it is difficult to escape from your upbringing--directly forbade him to seduce his best friend's wife. Another stumbling block to doing as he pleased was the very idea of chivalry or of civilization which Arthur had first invented and then introduced into his own young mind. Perhaps a bad baron who believed in the Strong Arm might have gone off with Guenever, even in the face of his Church's councils, because taking your neighbour's wife was really a form of Fort Mayne. It was a matter of the stronger bull winning.
But Lancelot had spent his childhood between knightly exercises and thinking out King Arthur's theory for himself. He believed as firmly as Arthur did, as firmly as the benighted Christian, that there was such a thing as Right. Finally, there was the impediment of his nature. In the secret parts of his peculiar brain, those unhappy and inextricable tangles which he felt at the roots, the boy was disabled by something which we cannot explain. He could
not have explained either, and for us it is all too long ago. He loved Arthur and he loved Guenever and he hated himself. The best knight of the world: everybody envied the self- esteem which must surely be his. But Lancelot never believed he was good or nice. Under the grotesque, magnificent shell with a face like Quasimodo's, there was shame and self-loathing which had been planted there when he was tiny, by something which it is now too late to trace. It is so fatally easy to make young children believe that they are horrible.
"It seems to me," said Uncle Dap, "that it depends very largely on what the Queen wants to do."
11 Lancelot stayed at the court for several weeks this time, and each week made it more difficult to go away. On top of the more or less social tangle in which he found himself, there was a personal puzzle--for he put a higher value on chastity than is fashionable in our century. He believed, like the man in Lord Tennyson, that people could only have the strength of ten on account of their hearts being pure. It so happened that his strength was as the strength of ten, and such was the medieval explanation which had been discovered for it. As a corollary to this belief, he supposed that if he gave in to the Queen he would lose his tenfold might. So, for this reason, as well as for the other ones, he fought against her with the courage of despair. It was not pleasant for Guenever either.
One day Uncle Dap said: "You had better go away. You have lost nearly two stone in weight If you go away something will either snap or not snap. It is better to get it over quickly."
Lancelot said: "I cannot go."
Arthur said: "Please stay."
Guenever said: "Go."
The second quest which he embarked upon was the turning-point of his life. There had been a good deal of talk in Camelot about a certain King Pelles, who was lame and lived in the haunted castle of Corbin. He was supposed to be slightly mad, because he believed himself to be a relation of Joseph of Arimathea. He was the sort of man who would become a British Israelite nowadays, and spend the rest of his life prophesying the end of the world by measuring the passages in the Great Pyramid. However, King Pelles was only slightly mad, and his castle was certainly haunted. It had a haunted room in it, with innumerable doors out of which things came and fought you in the night. Arthur thought it was worth sending Lancelot to investigate the place.
On the way to Corbin Lancelot had a strange adventure, which he remembered for many years with awful grief. He was to look back on it as the last adventure of his virginity, and to believe, day by day for the next twenty years, that before it had happened he had been God's man, while, after it, he had become a lie.
There was a village under the castle of Corbin, which seemed a prosperous one. It had cobbled streets and stone houses and old bridges. The castle stood on a hill to one side of the valley, and there was a handsome pele tower on the hill of the other side. All the people of the village were in the street, as if they were waiting for nun, and there was a dreamlike quality in the air, as if a shower of gold dust had come from the sun. Lancelot felt peculiar.
His blood might have had too much oxygen in it, from the way he was conscious of every stone in every wall, and all the colours in the valley, and the joyful stepping of his horse. The people of the enchanted village knew his name.
"Welcome, Sir Lancelot Dulac," they cried, "the flower of all knighthood 1 By thee we shall be holpen out of danger."
He reined his horse and spoke to them.
"Why do you call out to me?" he asked, thinking of other things. "How do you know my name? What is the matter?"
They answered in chorus, speaking together solemnly and without difficulty.
"Ah, fair knight," they said. "Do you see that tower on the hill? There is a dolorous lady in it, who has been kept boiling in scalding water for many winters by magic, and nobody can get her out except the best knight in the world. Sir Gawaine was here last week, but he could not do it."
"If Sir Gawaine could not do it," he said, "I am sure that I can't."
He did not like this sort of competition. The danger about being the best knight in the world was that if you were always being tested about it, the day was bound to come when you would fail to retain the title.
"I think I had better ride on," he said, and he gave his reins a shake.
"No, no," said the people gravely. "You are Sir Lancelot and we know it. You will get our lady out of the boiling water."
"I must go."
"She is in pain."
Lancelot leaned on the withers of his horse, lifted his right leg over the crupper, and found himself on the ground. "Tell me what I must do," he said.
The people formed in a procession round him, and the mayor of the village took him by the hand. They walked together silently up the hill to the pele tower, except that the major explained the situation as they went.
"Our lady of the manor," said the mayor, "used to be the most beautiful girl in the country. So Queen Morgan le Fay and the Queen of Northgalis grew jealous of her, and they have put her in this magic for revenge. It is terrible how it hurts her, and she has been boiling for five years. Only the best knight in the world can get her out."
When they came to the tower gate, another strange thing happened. It was heavily bolted and barred in the old-fashioned way. The masonry of the doorway was constructed with deep slots in it, in which heavy beams ran to and fro-- heavy enough to withstand a battering ram. Now these beams withdrew into the wall of their own accord, and the iron locks turned their
own wards with a grinding noise. The door quietly opened.
"Go in," said the mayor, and the people stood still outside, waiting for what was to happen.
On the first floor of the tower there was the furnace which kept the magic water hot Lancelot could not enter there. On the second floor there was a room full of steam, so that he could not see across it. He went into this room, holding his hands joined together in front of him, as blind people do, until he heard a squeak. A clearing in the steam, caused by the draught from the door so long unopened, showed him the lady who had given the squeak. She was sitting shyly in the bath looking at him, a charming little lady, who was--as Malory puts it--as naked as a needle. "WellJ" said he.
The girl blushed, so far as she could blush when she was boiled, and said in a small voice: "Please give me your hand." She knew how the magic had to be undone.
Lancelot gave her his hand, and she stood up, and got out of the bath, and all the people outside began cheering, as though they knew exactly what was happening. They had brought a dress with them, and the proper underwear, and the ladies of the village formed a circle in the gateway while the pink girl was dressed.
"Oh, it does feel lovely to be dressed!" she said. "My popsy!" cried a fat old woman who had evidently been her nurse when she was small, weeping tears of joy.
"Sir Lancelot done it," shouted the villagers. "Three cheers for Sir LancelotI"
When the cheering had died away, the boiled girl came to him and put her hand in his.
"Thank you," she said. "Ought we to go to church now, and thank God as well as you?" "Certainly we must."
So they went to the clean little chapel in the village and thanked God for His mercies. They kneeled between the frescoed walls, where some important-looking saints with blue haloes were standing on tiptoe to avoid foreshortening, and the gay paints of the stained-glass window poured upon their heads. They were cobalt blue, purple from manganese, yellow from copper, red, and a green which was also got from copper. The whole inside of the place was a tankful of colour. It was half-way through the service before he realized that he had been allowed to do a miracle, just as he had always wanted.
King Pelles limped down from his castle on the other side of the valley, to find out what the excitement was about. He looked at Lancelot's shield, kissed the boiled child absent- mindedly, leaning over like an obedient stork to have his cheek pecked, and remarked: "Dear me, you are Sir Lancelot! And I see you have fetched my daughter out of that kettle arrangement. How kind of you! It was prophesied long ago. I am King Pelles, near cousin to Joseph of Arimathea--and you, of course, are but the eighth degree from Our Lord Jesus Christ."
"Good gracious!"
"Indeed, indeed," said King Pelles. "It is all written down arithmetically in the stones at Stonehenge, and I have some sort of holy dish in my castle at Carbonek, together with a dove
which flies about in various directions holding a censer of gold in its beak. Still, it was extremely kind of you to fetch my daughter out of the kettle."
"Daddy," said the girl. "We ought to be introduced."
King Pelles waved his hand as if he were trying to scare away the midges.
"Elaine," he said. It was another one with the same name. "This is my daughter, Elaine. How do you do? And this is Sir Lancelot Dulac. How do you do? All written in the stones."
Lancelot, perhaps slightly biased by having first met her with no clothes on, thought that Elaine was the most beautiful girl he had seen, except Guenever. He felt shy too.
"You must come and stay with me," said the King. "That is in the stones also. Show you the holy dish some day, and all that. Teach you arithmetic. Nice weather. Don't have daughters unboiled every day. I think dinner will be ready."
12 Lancelot stayed at the castle of Corbin for days. Its haunted rooms were up to expectation, and there was nothing else to do. He felt such feelings in his breast because of Guenever--the frightful pang of hopeless love--that he was drained of effort. He could not summon the energy to go elsewhere. At the beginning of his love for her there had been restlessness, so that he had felt that if only he kept moving and doing new things every moment there might be a hope of escape. Now his power to be busy was gone. He felt that he might as well be in one place as another, if he was only waiting to see whether his heart would break or not. He was too simple to see that if the finest knight in the world rescued you out of a kettle of boiling water, with no clothes on, you would be likely to fall in love with him-- if you were only eighteen.
One evening, when Pelles had been particularly tiresome about religious family trees, and when the gnawing in the boy's heart had made it impossible for him to eat properly or even to sit still at dinner, the butler took the situation in hand. He had served the Pelles family for forty years, was married to the nurse who had greeted Elaine with tears of joy, and he approved of love. He also understood about young men like Lancelot--young men who might still be undergraduates or jet-pilots if they were in England today. He would have made an excellent college butler. "More wine, sir?" asked the butler. "No, thank you."
The butler bowed politely and poured another horn, which Lancelot drained without looking at it
"A nice vintage, sir," said the butler. "His Majesty takes great trouble with his cellar."
King Pelles had gone to the library to work out some prognostications, and his guest was left gloomily in the hall. "Yes."
There was a rustling outside the buttery door, and the butler went over to it while Lancelot was drinking another measure.
"Now this is a fine wine, sir," said the butler. "His Majesty sets great store by this wine, and
my wife has just fetched up a fresh bottle from the cellar. Observe the crust, sir. It is a wine which I am sure you will appreciate." "All wines are the same to me."
"You modest young gentleman," said the butler, substituting a large horn. "If I may say so, sir, you will have your little joke. But it is easy to recognize a judge of wine when you come across him."
He was bothering Lancelot, who wanted to be alone with his misery, and Lancelot realized that he was being bothered. For this reason he automatically wondered whether he had not perhaps been discourteous to the butler in his distraction. Perhaps the butler was really keen on the wine, and had troubles of his own. He politely drank it up.
"Very nice," he said encouragingly. "A splendid vintage."
"I am glad to hear you praise it, sir."
"Have you ever," asked Lancelot, putting the question which all young men are always asking, and without noticing that it had anything to do with the drink, "have you ever been in love?"
The butler smiled discreetly and poured another bumper.
By midnight Lancelot and the butler were sitting on opposite sides of the table, both looking red in the face. They had a brew of piment between them--a mixture of red wine, honey, spices, and whatever else the butler's wife had added.
"So I tell you," said Lancelot, glaring like an ape. "Wouldn't tell everybody, but you are a nice chap. Understanding chap. Pleasure to tell anything. Have another drink."
"Good health," said the butler.
"What am I to do?" he cried. "What am I to do?"
He put bis horrible head between his arms on the table, and began to weep.
"Courage!" said the butler. "Do or die!"
He made a rapping on the table with one hand, looking at the buttery door, and with the other poured out another bumper.
"Drink," he said. "Drink hearty. Be a man, sir, if I may make so bold. You will have good news in a minute, that you will, and you want to seize the unforgiving minute, as the bard says."
"Good chap," said Lancelot. "Damned if I wouldn't, if I could."
"Jack is as good as his master."
"Certainly is," said the young man, winking in a way which he was afraid must look most beastly. "Better, in fact, eh, butler?"
He began to grin like an ass.
"Ah," said the butler, "and there is my wife Brisen at the buttery door, holding a message. I dare say it might be for you.
"What does it say?" asked the butler, watching the boy who sat staring at the paper.
"Nothing," he said, throwing the paper on the table and walking unsteadily to the door.
The butler read the paper.
"It says that Queen Guenever is at the castle of Case, five miles from here, and she wants you. It says the King is not with her. There are some kisses on it."
"Well?"
"You dare not go," said the butler.
"Dare not?" shouted Sir Lancelot, and he went into the darkness staggering, laughing like a caricature, and calling for his horse.
In the morning he woke suddenly in a strange room. It was quite dark, with tapestry over the windows, and he had no headache because his constitution was good. He jumped out of bed and went to the window, to draw the curtain. He was fully aware, in the suddenness of a second, of all that bad happened on the previous night--aware of the butler and of the drink and of the love-potion which had perhaps been put in it, of the message from Guenever, and of the dark, solid, cool-fired body in the bed which he had just got out of. He drew the curtain and leaned his forehead against the cold stone of the mullion. He was miserable.
"Jenny," he said, after minutes which seemed to be hours.
There was no answer from the bed.
He turned round and found himself looking at the boiled girl, Elaine. She lay in the bed, her small bare arms holding the bedclothes to her sides, with her violet eyes fixed on his.
Lancelot was always a martyr to his feelings, never any good at disguising them. When he saw Elaine his head went back. Then his ugly face took on a look of profound and outraged sorrow, so simple and truthful that his nakedness in the window-light was dignity. He began to tremble.
Elaine did not move, but only looked upon him with her quick eyes, like a mouse.
Lancelot went over to the chest where his sword was lying.
"I shall kill you."
She only looked. She was eighteen, pitifully small in the big bed, and she was frightened.
"Why did you do it?" he cried. "What have you done? Why have you betrayed me?"
"I had to."
"But it was treacheryl"
He could not believe it of her.
"It was treachery! You have betrayed me."
"Why?"
"You have made me--taken from me--stolen--"
He threw his sword into a corner and sat down on the chest. When he began to cry, the gross lines of his face screwed thelmselves up fantastically. The thing which Elaine had stolen from him was his might. She had stolen his strength of ten. Children believe such things to this day, and think that they will only be able to bowl well in the cricket match tomorrow, provided that they are good today.
Lancelot stopped crying, and spoke with his eyes on the floor.
"When I was little," he said, "I prayed to God that he would let me work a miracle. Only virgins can work miracles. I wanted to be the best knight in the world. I was ugly and lonely. The people of your village said that I was the best knight of the world, and I did work my Miracle when I got you out of the water. I did not know it would be my last as well as my first."
Elaine said: "Oh, Lancelot, you will work plenty more.'
"Never. You have stolen my miracles. You have stolen my being the best knight. Elaine, why did you do it?"
She began to cry.
He got up, wrapped himself in a towel, and went over to the bed.
"Never mind," he said. "It was my fault for getting drunk. I was miserable, and I got drunk. I wonder if that butler tried to make me? It was not very fair if he did. Don't cry, Elaine. It was not your fault.",
"It was. It was."
"Probably your father made you do it, so as to have the eighth degree from Our Lord in the family. Or else it was that enchantress Brisen, the butler's wife. Don't be sorry about it, Elaine. It is over now. Look, I will give you a kiss."
"Lancelot!" cried Elaine. "It was because I loved you. Haven't I given something too? I was a maiden, Lancelot. I didn't rob you. Oh, Lancelot'--it was my fault. I ought to be killed. Why didn't you kill me with your sword? But it was because I loved you, and I couldn't help it."
'There, there."
"Lancelot, suppose I have a baby?"
He stopped comforting her and went to the window again, as if he were going mad.
"I want to have your baby," said Elaine. "I shall call him Galahad, like your first name."
She still held the coverlet to her sides with the small, bare arms. Lancelot turned upon her in fury.
"Elaine," he said, "if you have a baby, it is your baby. It is unfair to bind me with pity. I am going straight away now, and I hope I shall never see you again."
Guenever was doing some petit point in the gloomy room, which she hated doing. It was for a shield-cover for Arthur, and had the dragon rampant gules. Elaine was only eighteen, and it is fairly easy to explain the feelings of a child--but Guenever was twenty-two. She had grown to have some of the nature of an individual, stamped on the simple feelings of the child-queen who had once received her present of captives.
There is a thing called knowledge of the world, which people do not have until they are middle-aged. It is something which cannot be taught to younger people, because it is not logical and does not obey laws which are constant. It has no rules. Only, in the long years which bring women to the middle of life, a sense of balance develops. You can't teach a baby to walk by explaining the matter to her logically--she has to learn the strange poise of walking by experience. In some way like that, you cannot teach a young woman to have knowledge of the world. She has to be left to the experience of the years. And then, when she is beginning to hate her used body, she suddenly finds that she can do it. She can go on living--not by principle, not by deduction, not by knowledge of good and evil, but simply by a peculiar and shifting sense of balance which defies each of these things often. She no longer hopes to live by seeking the truth--if women ever do hope this--but continues henceforth under the guidance of a seventh sense. Balance was the sixth sense, which she won when she first learned to walk, and now she has the seventh one--knowledge of the world.
The slow discovery of the seventh sense, by which both men and women contrive to ride the waves of a world in which there is war, adultery, compromise, fear, stultification and hypocrisy--this discovery is not a matter for triumph. The baby, perhaps, cries out triumphantly: I have balance! But the seventh sense is recognized without a cry. We only carry on with our famous knowledge of the world, riding the queer waves in a habitual, petrifying way, because we have reached a stage of deadlock in which we can think of nothing else to do.
And at this stage we begin to forget that there ever was a time when we lacked the seventh sense. We begin to forget, as we go stolidly balancing along, that there could have been a time when we were young bodies flaming with the impetus of life. It is hardly consoling to remember such a feeling, and so it deadens in our minds.
But there was a time when each of us stood naked before the world, confronting life as a serious problem with which we were intimately and passionately concerned. There was a time when it was of vital interest to us to find out whether there was a God or not. Obviously the existence or otherwise of a future life must be of the very first importance to somebody who is going to live her present one, because her manner of living it must hinge on the problem. There was a time when Free Love versus Catholic Morality was a question of as much importance to our hot bodies as if a pistol had been clapped to our heads.
Further back, there were times when we wondered with all our souls what the world was, what love was, what we were ourselves.
All these problems and feelings fade away when we get the seventh sense. Middle-aged people can balance between believing in God and breaking all the commandments, without difficulty. The seventh sense, indeed, slowly kills all the other ones, so that at last there is no trouble about the commandments. We cannot see any more, or feel, or hear about them. The bodies which we loved, the truths which we sought, the Gods whom we questioned: we are deaf and blind to them now, safely and automatically balancing along toward the inevitable grave, under the protection of our last sense. "Thank God for the aged," sings the poet:
Thank God for the aged And for age itself, and illness and the grave. When we are old and ill, and particularly in the coffin, It is no trouble to behave.
Guenever was twenty-two as she sat at her petit point and thought of Lancelot. She was not half-way to her coffin, not ill even, and she only had six senses. It is difficult to imagine her.
A chaos of the mind and body--a time for weeping at sunsets and at the glamour of moonlight--a confusion and profusion of beliefs and hopes, in God, in Truth, in Love, and in Eternity--an ability to be transported by the beauty of physical objects--a heart to ache or swell--a joy so joyful and a sorrow so sorrowful that oceans could lie between them: then, as a counterpoise to these attractive features, outcrops of selfishness indecently exposed-- restlessness or inability to settle down and stop bothering the middle-aged--pert argument on abstract subjects like Beauty, as if they were of any interest to the middle-aged-- lack of experience as to when truth should be suppressed in deference to the middle-aged--general effervescence and nuisance and unfittingness to the set patterns of the seventh sense--these must have been some of Guenever's characteristics at twenty-two, because they are everybody's. But on top of them there were the broad and yet uncertain lines of her personal character--lines which made her different from the innocent Elaine, lines of less pathos perhaps but more reality, lines of power which made her into the individual Jenny that Lancelot loved.
"Oh, Lancelot," she sang as she stitched at the shield-crown. "Oh, Lance, come back soon. Come back with your crooked smile, or with your own way of walking which shows whether you are angry or puzzled--come back to tell me that it does not matter whether love is a sin or not. Come back to say that it is enough that I should be Jenny and you should be Lance, whatever may happen to anybody."
The startling thing was that he came. Straight from Elaine, straight from her robbery,
Lancelot came like an arrow to the heart of love. He had slept with Guenever already in deceit, already had been cheated of his tenfold might. He was a lie now, in God's eyes as he saw them, so he felt that he might as well be a lie in earnest. No more to be the best knight in the world, no more to work miracles against magic, no more to have compensation for ugliness and emptiness in his soul, the young man sped to his sweetheart for consolation. There was the clatter of his iron-shod horse on the cobbles, which made the Queen drop her needlework to see whether it was Arthur back from his hunting--the ring of his chain-mail feet upon the stairs, going chink-chink like spurs against the stone--and then, before she was quite certain of what had happened, Guenever was laughing or weeping, unfaithful to her husband, as she had always known she would be.
14 Arthur said: "Here is a letter from your father, Lance. He says he is being atttacked by King Claudas. I promised to help him against Claudas, if it was necessary, in exchange for his help at Bedegraine. I shall have to go."
"I see."
"What do you want to do?"
"How do you mean, what do I want to do?"
"Well, do you want to come with me or to stay here?"
Lancelot cleared his throat and said: "I want to do whatever you think best."
"It will be difficult for you," said Arthur. "I hate to ask you. But would you mind if I asked you to stay?"
Lancelot could not think of the safe words, so the King mistook his silence for disappointment.
"Of course, you have a right to see your father and mother," he said. "I don't want you to stay, if it hurts too much. Probably we can manage it another way."
"Why did you want to leave me in England?"
"There ought to be somebody here to look after the factions. I should feel safer in France if I knew there was a strong man left behind. There is going to be trouble in Cornwall soon, between Tristram and Mark, and there is the Orkney feud. You know the difficulties. And it would be nice to think there was somebody looking after Gwen."
"Perhaps," said Lancelot, choosing the words with pain, "it would be better to trust somebody else."
"Don't be absurd. How could I trust anybody more? You would only have to show that mug of yours outside the dog kennel and all the thieves would run away at once."
"It is not a very handsome one."
"Cut-throat!" exclaimed the King affectionately, and he thumped his friend on the back. He went off to arrange about the expedition.
They had a year of joy, twelve months of the strange heaven which the salmon know on beds of river shingle, under the gin-clear water. For twenty-four years they were guilty, but this first year was the only one which seemed like happiness. Looking back on it, when they were old, they did not remember that in this year it had ever rained or frozen. The four seasons were coloured like the edge of a rose petal for them.
"I don't understand," said Lancelot, "why you should love me. Are you sure you do? Is there some mistake about it?"
"My Lance."
"But my face," he said. "I am so horrible. Now I can believe that God might love the world, whatever it was like, because of himself."
At other times, they were in a terror which came from him. Guenever did not feel remorse on her own account, but she caught it from her lover.
"I dare not think. Don't think. Kiss me, Jenny."
"Why think?"
"I can't help thinking."
"Dear Lance!"
Then there were different times when they quarrelled about nothing--but even the quarrels were those of lovers, which seemed sweet when they remembered them afterwards.
"Your toes are like the little pigs which went to market."
"I wish you would not say things like that. It is not respectful."
"Respectful!"
"Yes, respectful. Why shouldn't you be respectful? I am the Queen, after all."
"Do you seriously mean to tell me that I am supposed to treat you with respect? I suppose I am to kneel on one knee all the time and kiss your hand?"
"Why not?"
"I wish you wouldn't be so selfish. If there is one thing I can't stand, it is being treated like a possession."
"Selfish, indeed!"
And the Queen would stamp her foot, or perhaps sulk for a day. But she forgave him when he had made a proper act of contrition.
One day, when they were at the stage of telling each other their private feelings, with a sort of innocent amazement when they corresponded, Lancelot gave the Queen his secret.
"Jenny, when I was little I hated myself. I don't know why. I was ashamed. I was a very holy little boy."
"You are not very holy now," she said, laughing. She did not understand what she was being told.
"One day my brother asked me to lend him an arrow. I had two or three specially straight ones, which I was very careful of, and his were a bit warped. I pretended that I had lost my straight arrows, and said I couldn't lend them to him."
"Little liar!"
"I know I was. Afterwards I had the most dreadful remorse for having told him the lie, and I thought I had been untrue to God. So I went out to a bed of stinging nettles that was on the moat, and put my arrow arm into them, as a punishment. I rolled up my sleeve and put it right in." "Poor Lance! What an innocent you must have" been." "But, Jenny, they didn't sting me! I am sure I am right in remembering that they didn't sting me." "Do you mean there was a miracle?" "I don't know. It is difficult to be sure. I was such a dreamy boy, always living in a make-up world where I was Arthur's greatest knight. I may have made it up about the nettles. But I think I can remember the shock when they didn't sting."
"I am sure it was a miracle," said the Queen decidedly. "Jenny, all my life I have wanted to do miracles. I have wanted to be holy. I suppose it was ambition or pride or some other unworthy thing. It was not enough for me to conquer the world--I wanted to conquer heaven too. I was so grasping that it was not enough to be the strongest knight--I had to be the best as well. That is the worst of making day-dreams. It is why I tried to keep away from you. I knew that if I was not pure, I could never do miracles.
And I did do a miracle, too: a splendid one. I got a girl out of some boiling water, who was enchanted into it. She was called Elaine. Then I lost my power. Now that we are together, I shall never be able to do my miracles any more."
He did not like to tell her the full truth about Elaine, for he thought that it would hurt her feelings to know that he had come to her as the second.
"Why not?"
"Because we are wicked."
"Personally I have never done a miracle," said the Queen, rather coldly. "So I have less to regret."
"But, Jenny, I am not regretting anything. You are my miracle, and I would throw them overboard all over again for the sake of you. I was only trying to tell you about the things I
felt when I was small."
"Well, I can't say I understand."
"Can't you understand wanting to be good at things? No, I can see that you would not have to. It is only people who are lacking, or bad, or inferior, who have to be good at things. You have always been full and perfect, so you had nothing to make up for. But I have always been making up. I feel dreadful sometimes, even now, with you, when I know that I can't be the best knight any longer."
"Then we had better stop, and you can make a good confession, and do some more miracles."
"You know we can't stop."
"The whole thing seems fanciful to me," said the Queen. "I don't understand it. It seems unpractical and selfish."
"I know I am selfish. I can't help it. I try not to be. But how can I help being what I was made? Oh, can't you understand what I am telling you? I was lonely when I was small, and I worked hard at my exercises. I used to tell myself that I would be a great explorer, and cross the Chorasmian Waste: or I would be a great king, like Alexander or St. Louis: or a great healer: I would find out a balsam which cured wounds and give it away free: perhaps I would be a saint, and salve wounds just by touching them, or I would find something important--a relic of the True Cross, or the Holy Grail, or something like that. These were my dreams, Jenny. I am only telling you what I used to day-dream about. They are what I mean by my miracles, which are lost now. I have given you my hopes, Jenny, as a present from my love."
15 The year of their happiness ended with Arthur's return--and almost immediately collapsed in ruin, but not on account of the King. The evening after his home-coming, while he was still giving them details of the defeat of Claudas as they happened to come into his memory, there was a disturbance at the Porter's Lodge, and Sir Bors was ushered into the Great Hall at
dinner. He was Lancelot's cousin, and had been spending a holiday at the castle of Corbin, investigating the hauntings. He had some news for Lancelot, which he told him in a whisper after dinner--but unfortunately he was a misogynist, and, like most people of that sort, he had the female failing of indiscretion. He told the news to some of his bosom friends as well. Soon it was all over the court. The news was that Elaine of Corbin had given birth to a fine son, whom she had christened Galahad --which was Lancelot's first name, as you remember.
"So this," said Guenever, when she next saw her lover alooe, "so this is why you lost your miracles. It was all lies about your giving them to me." "What do you mean?"
Guenever began to breathe through her nose. She was feeling as if there were two red thumbs behind her eyeballs, trying to push them out, and she did not want to look at him. She was trying not to make a scene, and she dreaded her heart. She had shame and hatred of what she might say, but she could not help saying it. She was like a person swimming in a rough sea.
"You know what I mean," she said bitterly, looking away. "Jenny, I wanted to tell you, but it
was too difficult to explain."
"I can understand the difficulty."
"It is not what you think."
"What I think!" she cried. "How do you know what I think? I think what everybody would think--that you are a mean seducer, just a liar, you and your miracles. And I was fool enough to believe you."
Lancelot turned his head at each of her stabs, as if he were trying to let them glance off him. He looked on the ground, to hide his eyes. He had wide eyes, which generally gave him an expression of fear or surprise.
"Elaine means nothing to me," he said.
"Then she ought to do. How can you say that she means nothing to you when she is the mother of your child? When you tried to keep her secret? No, don't touch me, go away."
"I can't go away, when it is like this."
"If you touch me I shall go to the King."
"Guenever, I was made drunk at Corbin. Then they told me that you were waiting for me at Case, and they took me to a dark room with Elaine in it. I came away next morning."
"A clumsy lie."
"It is true."
"A baby wouldn't believe it."
"I can't make you believe it, if you don't want to. I drew my sword to kill Elaine, when I found out"
"I will have her killed.-"
"It was not her fault."
The Queen began plucking at the neck of her dress, as if it were too tight for her.
"You are standing up for her," she said. "You are in love with her, and deceiving me. I thought so all along."
"I swear I am telling the truth."
She suddenly gave up and began to cry.
"Why didn't you tell me before?" she asked. "Why didn't you tell me you had a baby? Why have you lied to me all the time? I suppose she was your famous miracle, which you were so
proud of."
Lancelot, who also suffered from violent emotions, began to cry in turn. He put his arms around her.
"I didn't know I had one," he said. "I didn't want one. It was not my seeking."
"If you had told me the truth, I could have believed you."
"I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't. I was afraid you would be hurt."
"It has hurt me worse like this."
"I know it has."
The Queen dried her tears and looked at him, smiling like a spring shower. In a minute they were kissing, feeling like the green earth refreshed by rain. They thought that they understood each other once more--but their doubt had been planted. Now, in their love, which was stronger, there were the seeds of hatred and fear and confusion growing at the same time: for love can exist with hatred, each preying on the other, and this is what gives it its greatest fury.
16 In the castle of Corbin, the child Elaine was making ready for her journey. She was coming to capture Lancelot from Guenever, an expedition of which everybody except herself could feel the pathos. She had no weapons to fight with, and did not know how to fight. She was quite without character. Lancelot did not love her. And she was in the yet more hopeless position of loving him. She had nothing to oppose against the Queen's maturity except her own immaturity and humble love, nothing except the fat baby which she was carrying to its father--a baby which was to him only the symbol of a cruel trick. It was an expedition like that of an army without weapons against an impregnable fortress, an army which at the same time had its hands tied behind its back. Elaine, with an artlessness which could only be explained by the fact that she had spent most of her life in the seclusion of her magic cauldron, had decided to meet Guenever on her own ground. She had ordered gowns of the utmost magnificence and sophistication--and in these, which would only make her look all the more stupid and provincial, she was going to Camelot to fight her battle with the English Queen.
If Elaine had not been Elaine, she might have taken Galahad as her weapon. Pathos and proprietorship, rightly applied to a nature like Lancelot's, might have been successful in binding him. But Elaine was not clever, did not understand the attempt to bind her hero. She took Galahad because she adored him. She took him only because she did not want to be parted from her baby, and because she wanted to show him off to his father, and partly because she wanted to compare the faces. It was a year since she had set eyes on the man for whom her child-mind lived.
Lancelot, while Elaine was planning his capture, remained with the Queen at court. But he now remained without the temporary peace of heart which he had been able to invent for himself while the King was away. In the King's absence he had been able to drown himself in the passing minute--but Arthur was perpetually at his elbow now, as a comment on his
treachery. He had not buried his love for Arthur in his passion for Guenever, but still felt for him. To a medieval nature like Lancelot's, with its fatal weakness for loving the highest when he saw it, this was a position of pain. He could not bear to be made to feel that his sentiment for Guenever was an ignoble sentiment, for it was the profound feeling of his life--yet every circumstance now conspired to make it seem ignoble. The hasty moments together, the locked doors and base contrivances, the guilty manoarvres which the husband's presence forced on the lovers--these had the effect of soiling what had no excuse unless it was beautiful. On top of this stain there was the torture of knowing that Arthur was kind, simple and upright--of knowing that he was always on the edge of hurting Arthur dreadfully, although he loved him. Then there was pain about Guenever herself, the tiny plant of bitterness which they had sown, or seen sown, in each other's eyes, on the occasion of their first quarrel of suspicion. It was a pain to him to be in love with a jealous and suspicious woman. She had given him a mortal blow by not believing his explanation about Elaine instantly. Yet he was unable not to love her. Finally there were the revolted elements of his own character--his strange desire for purity and honour and spiritual excellence. All these things, working together with the unconscious dread of Elaine's arrival with his son, broke his happiness without allowing him to escape. He seldom sat down, but strayed about with nervous movements, picking things up and setting them down without looking at them, walking to windows and looking out but seeing nothing.
For Guenever the dread of Elaine's arrival was not unconscious. She had known from the first moment that Elaine was bound to come. For her, however, as for all women, the dreads were in advance of the male horizon. Men often accuse women of driving them to unfaithfulness by senseless jealousy, before there has been any thought of unfaithfulness on their own part. Yet the thought was probably there, unconscious and undetectable except to women. The great Anna Karenina, for instance, forced Vronsky into a certain position by the causeless jealousy of a maniac--yet that position was the only real solution to their problem, and it was the inevitable solution. Seeing so much further into the future than he did, she pressed towards it with passionate tread, wrecking the present because the future was bound to be a wreck.
So with Guenever. Probably she was not over-strained by Elaine's immediate problem. Probably she had no real suspicion against that side of Lancelot. Yet, with her prescience, she was aware of dooms and sorrows outside her lover's purview. It would not be accurate to say that she was aware of them in a logical sense, but they were present in her deeper mind. It is a pity that language is such a clumsy weapon that we cannot say that a mother was "unconscious" of her baby crying in the next room--with the meaning that the mother somehow, unconsciously, knew that it was crying. Facts of which Guenever was subconscious, in this sense, included the whole of the Arthur-Lancelot situation, most of the future tragedy at court, and the grievous fact of her own childlessness--which was never to be remedied. She said to herself that Lancelot had betrayed her, that she was the victim of Elaine's cunning, that her lover was sure to betray her again. She tormented herself with a thousand words of the same sort. But what she felt to herself, in the uncharted regions of her heart, was a different matter. Perhaps she was actually jealous, not of Elaine, but of the baby. Perhaps it was Lancelot's love for Arthur that she feared. Or it may have been a fear of the whole position, of its instability' and the nemesis inherent in it. Women know, far better than men, that God's laws are not mocked. They have more cause to know it.
Whatever the explanation of Guenever's attitude, the fruits of it were pain for her lover. She became as restless as he was, more unreasonable, and much more cruel.
Arthur's feelings completed the misery of the court. He, unfortunately for himself, had been beautifully brought up. His teacher had educated him as the child is educated in the womb, where it lives the history of man from fish to mammal--and, like the child in the womb, he had been protected with love meanwhile. The effect of such an education was that he had grown up without any of the useful accomplishments for living--without malice, vanity, suspicion, cruelty, and the commoner forms of selfishness. Jealousy seemed to him the most ignoble of vices. He was sadly unfitted for hating his best friend or for torturing his wife. He had been given too much love and trust to be good at these things.
Arthur was not one of those interesting characters whose subtle motives can be dissected. He was only a simple and affectionate man, because Merlyn had believed that love and simplicity were worth having.
Now, with a situation developing before his eyes which has always been notoriously difficult of solution--so difficult that it has been given a label and called the Eternal Triangle, as if it were a geometrical problem like the Pons Asinorum in Euclid--Arthur was only able to retreat. It is generally the trustful and optimistic people who can afford to retreat. The loveless and faithless ones are compelled by their pessimism to attack. Arthur was strong and gentle enough to hope that, if he trusted Lancelot and Guenever, things would come right in the end. It seemed to him that this was better than trying to bring them right at once by such courses as, for instance, by cutting off the lovers' heads for treason.
Arthur did not know that Lancelot and Guenever were lovers. He had never actually found them together or unearthed proofs of thek guilt. It was in the nature of his bold mind to hope, in these circumstances, that he would not find them together--rather than to lay a trap by which to wreck the situation. This is not to say that he was a conniving husband. It is simply that he was hoping to weather the trouble by refusing to become conscious of it. Unconsciously, of course, he knew perfectly well that they were sleeping together--knew too, unconsciously, that if he were to ask his wife, she would admit it. Her three great virtues were courage, generosity and honesty. So he could not ask her.
Such an attitude to the position did not make it easier for the King to be happy. He became, not excitable like Guenever nor restless like Lancelot, but reserved. He moved about his own palace like a mouse. Yet he made one effort to grasp the nettle,
"Lancelot," said the King, finding him one afternoon in the rose garden, "you have been looking wretched lately. Is there anything the matter?"
Lancelot had snapped off one of the roses, and was pinching the sepals. These ancient roses, it has lately been asserted, were so constructed that the five sepals did actually stick out beyond the petals--just as they are represented to do in the heraldic rose.
"Is it anything," asked the King, hoping against hope, "about this girl who is said to have had your baby?"
If Arthur had left him alone with the first question, and a silence to answer it in, perhaps they would have had the matter out But Arthur was afraid of what might come in the silence, and, once he had given the lead of the second question, the chance was gone. "Yes," said Lancelot.
"You could not bring yourself to marry her, I suppose?" "I don't love her."
"Well, you know your own business best." Lancelot, with an uncontrollable desire to get some of his misery off his chest by telling about it--and yet unable to tell the true story to this particular listener--began a long rigmarole about Elaine. He began telling Arthur half the truth: how he was ashamed and had lost his miracles. But he was forced to make Elaine the central figure of this confession, and, after half an hour, he had unwittingly presented the King with a story to believe in--a story with which Arthur could content himself if he did not want to be conscious of the true tale. This half-truth was of great use to the poor fellow, who learned to substitute it for the real trouble in later years. We civilized people, who would immediately fly to divorce courts and alimony and other forms of attrition in such circumstances, can afford to look with proper contempt upon the spineless cuckold. But Arthur was only a medieval savage. He did not understand our civilization, and knew no better than to try to be too decent for the degradation of jealousy.
Guenever was the next person to find Lancelot in the rose garden. She was all sweetness and reason.
"Lance, have you heard the news? A messenger has just arrived to say that this girl who is persecuting you is on her way to court, bringing the baby. She will be here this evening." "I knew she would come."
"We shall have to do our best for her, of course. Poor child, I expect she is unhappy."
"It is not my fault if she is unhappy."
"No, of course it isn't. But people get made unhappy by the world, and we must help them when we can."
"Jenny, it is sweet of you to be kind about it."
He turned towards her, and made a movement to catch her hand. Her words had made him hope that all would be well. But Jenny took her hand away.
"No, dear," she said. "I don't want you to make love to me until she has gone. I want you to be quite free."
"Free?"
"She is the mother of your baby, and she is unmarried. We two can't ever be married. I want you to be able to marry her if you would like it, because that is the only thing which can be done."
"But, Jenny--"
"No, Lance. We must be sensible. I want you to keep away from me while she is here, and to find out whether you could love her after all. It is the least that I can do for you."
17
Elaine arrived at the yawning barbican, and Guenever kissed her coolly. "You are welcome to Camelot," she said. "Five thousand welcomes."
"Thank you," said Elaine.
They looked at each other with hostile, smiling faces.
"Lancelot will be delighted to see you."
"Oh!"
"Everybody knows about the baby, dear. There is nothing to be shy about. The King and I are quite excited to see whether he will be like his father."
"It is kind of you," said Elaine uncomfortably.
"You must let me be the first to see him. You have called him Galahad, have you not? Is he strong? Does he notice things?"
"He weighs fifteen pounds," the girl announced with pride. "You can see him now, if you like."
Guenever took hold of herself with an effort which was hardly noticeable, and began fussing with Elaine's wraps. "No, dear," she said. "I must not be so selfish as that. You must rest after your long journey, and probably Baby will have to be settled down. I can come to see him this evening, when he has had a sleep. There will be plenty of time."
But she had to see the baby in the end. When Lancelot next met the Queen, her sweetness and reason were gone. She was cold and proud, and spoke as if she were addressing a meeting.
"Lancelot," she said, "I think you ought to go to your son. Elaine is grieving because you have not been to see him."
"Have- you seen him?" "Yes."
"Is he ugly?" "He takes after Elaine." "Thank God. I will go at once." The Queen called him back.
"Lancelot," she said, taking a breath through her nose, "I am trusting you not to make love to Elaine under my roof. If you and I are to keep apart until it is settled, it is only fair that you should keep away from her." "I don't want to make love to Elaine." "You must say that, of course. And I will believe you. But if you break your word this time, it will be finished between us. Absolutely finished." "I have said all I can say."
"Lancelot, you have deceived me once, so how can I be sure? I have put Elaine in the next room to mine, and I shall see if you go to it. I want you to keep in your own room."
"If you like."
"I shall send for you some time tonight, if I can get away from Arthur. I will not tell you
when. If you are not in your room when I send for you, I shall know that you are with Elaine."
The girl was weeping in her chamber, while Dame Brisen arranged the cradle for the little boy. "I saw him in the archery butts, and he saw me too. But he looked away. He made an excuse and went out. He has not even seen our baby."
"There, there," said Dame Brisen. "Lawks a mussy."
"I ought not to have come. It has only made me more miserable, and him too."
" 'Tis that there Queen."
"She is beautiful, isn't she?"
The Dame said darkly: "Handsome is as handsome does."
Elaine began to sob helplessly. She looked repulsive, with her red nose, as people do when they abdicate their dignity.
"I wanted him to be pleased."
There was a knock on the door, and Lancelot came in-- which made her quickly dry the eyes. They greeted each other with constraint.
"I am glad you have come to Camelot," he said. "I hope you are well?"
"Yes, thank you."
"How is--the baby?"
"Your lordship's son," said Dame Brisen with emphasis.
She turned the cradle towards him, and moved back so that he could see,
"My son."
They stood looking down at the fresh thing, helpless and only half alive. They were strong, as the poet sings, and it was weak--one day they would be weak, and it strong.
"Galahad," said Elaine, and she leaned over the wrappings, making the foolish gestures and meaningless sounds which mothers delight to use when their babies are beginning to pay attention. Galahad clenched his fist and hit himself in the eye with it, an achievement which seemed to give pleasure to the women. Lancelot watched them in amazement "My son," he thought. "It is a part of me, yet it is fair. It does not seem to be ugly. How can you tell with babies?" He held out his right finger to Galahad, putting it inside the fat palm of his hand, which clutched it. The hand looked as if it had been fitted to the arm by a cunning doll maker. There was a deep crease round the wrist "Oh, Lancelot!" cried Elaine.
She tried to throw herself into his arms, but he pushed her off. He looked at Brisen over her
shoulder with fear and exasperation. He made a wild, senseless sound--and rushed out of the room. Elaine, unsupported, sank down beside the bed and began to sob more than ever. Brisen, standing rigid, as she had stood to bear Sir Lancelot's glare, looked at the closed door with an inscrutable expression.
18 In the morning he and Elaine were summoned to the Queen's chamber. He, for his part, went with a kind of happiness. He was remembering how Guenever must have pleaded illness on the previous evening, so as to leave the King's room. Her lover had been sent for in the darkness. The usual conniving hand had led him by the finger on tiptoe to the chosen bed. In the silence forced on them by being next to Arthur's chamber, but in passionate tenderness, they had done their best to make it up. Lancelot was happier today than he had been since the story of Elaine started. He felt that if he could only persuade his Guenever to make a clean break with the King, so that everything was in the open, there might still be a possibility of honour.
Guenever was stiff, as if she were in a rigor, and her face was drained white--except that there was a red spot on either side of her nostrils. She looked as if she had been seasick. She was alone.
"So," said the Queen.
Elaine looked straight in her blue eyes, but Lancelot stopped as if he had been shot.
"So."
They stood, waiting for Guenever to speak or die.
"Where did you go last night?"
"I--"
"Don't tell me," shouted the Queen, moving her hand so that they could see a ball of handkerchief in it, which she had torn to pieces. "Traitor! Traitor! Get out of my castle with your strumpet."
"Last night--" said Lancelot. His head was whirling with a desperation which neither of the women noticed.
"Don't speak to me. Don't lie to me. Go!"
Elaine said calmly: "Sir Lancelot was in my room last night. My woman Brisen brought him in the dark."
The Queen began pointing at the door. She made stabbing movements at it with her finger, and, in her trembling, her hair began to come down. She looked hideous.
"Get out! Get out! And you go too, you animal! How dare you speak so in my castle? How dare you admit it to me? Take your fancy man and go!"
Lancelot was breathing heavily and looking upon the Queen with a fixed stare. He might have been unconscious.
"He thought he was coming to you," said Elaine. She had her hands folded together, and watched the Queen passively.
"The old lie!"
"It is not a lie," said Elaine. "I could not live without him. Brisen helped me to pretend."
Guenever ran up to her with tottering steps. She wanted to hit Elaine in the mouth, but the girl did not move. It was as if she was hoping that Guenever would hit her.
"Liar!" screamed the Queen.
She ran back to Lancelot, where he had sat down on a chest and was staring blankly at the floor, with his head between his hands. She caught hold of his mantle and began pushing or heaving him toward the door, but he would not move.
"So you taught her the story! Why couldn't you think of a new one? You might have given me something interesting. I suppose you thought the old, stale stuff would do?"
"Jenny--" he said, without looking up.
The Queen tried to spit on him, but she had never practised spitting.
"How dare you call me Jenny? You are reeking of her still. I am the Queen, the Queen of England! I am not your trull!"
"Jenny--"
"Get out of my castle," screamed the Queen at the top of her voice. "Never show your face in it again. Your evil, ugly, beastlike face."
Lancelot suddenly said to the floor, in a loud voice-"Galahad!"
Then he took down his hands from his head and looked up, so that they could see the face she spoke of. It had a surprised look, and one of the eyes had begun to squint.
He said, more quietly: "Jenny." But he looked like a blind man.
The Queen opened her mouth to say something, though nothing came out.
"Arthur," he said. Then he gave a loud shriek, and jumped straight out of the window, which was on the first floor. They could hear him crash into some bushes, with a crump and crackle of boughs, and then he was running off through the trees and shrubbery with a loud sort of warbling cry, like hounds hunting. The hullabaloo faded into the disstance, and there was silence in the chamber with the women.
Elaine, who was now as white as the Queen had been but still held herself proud and upright,
said: "You have driven him mad. His wits must have been weak."
Guenever said nothing.
"Why have you driven him mad?" asked Elaine. "You have a fine husband of your own, the greatest in the land. You are a Queen, with honour and happiness and a home. I had no home, and no husband, and my honour was gone too. Why would you not let me have him?"
The Queen was silent.
"I loved him," said Elaine. "I bore a fine son for him, who will be the best knight of the world."
"Elaine," said Guenever, "go away from my court."
"I am going."
Guenever suddenly caught her by the skirt.
"Don't tell anybody," she said quickly. "Don't say anything about what happened. It will be his death if you do."
Elaine freed the skirt
"Did you expect I would?"
"But what are we to do?" cried the Queen. "Is he mad? Will he get better? What will happen? Ought we to do something? What are we to say?"
Elaine would not stay to talk with her. At the door, however, she turned with a trembling lip.
"Yes, he is mad," she said. "You have won him, and you have broken him. What will you do with him next?"
When the door was closed, Guenever sat down. She dropped her tattered handkerchief. Then--slowly, deeply, primitively--she began to cry. She put her face in her hands and throbbed with sorrow. (Sir Bors, who did not care for the Queen, once said to her: "Fie on your weeping, for ye weep never but when there is no boot.")
19 King Pelles was sitting in the solar with Sir Bliant two years later. It was a fine whiter morning with the fields frosted, no wind, and a light fog which was not enough to confuse the pigeons. Sir Bliant, who had been staying the night, was dressed in scarlet furred with miniver. His horse and squire were in the courtyard, ready to take him back to Castle Bliant, but the two men were having their elevenses before he started. Sitting with their hands spread to the splendid log fire, they sipped their mulled wine, nibbled pastry, and talked about the Wild Man.
"I am sure he must have been a gentleman," said Sir Bliant. "He kept doing things which
nobody but a gentleman would do. He had a natural leaning to arms."
"Where is he now?" asked King Pelles.
"God He knows. He vanished one morning when the hounds were at Castle Bliant. But I am sure he was a gentleman."
They sipped and gazed into the flames.
"If you want to have my opinion," added Sir Bliant, lowering his voice, "I believe he was Sir Lancelot."
"Nonsense," said the King.
"He was tall and strong."
"Sir Lancelot is dead," said the King. "God be good to him. Everybody knows that."
"It was not proved."
"If he had been Sir Lancelot, you could not have mistaken him. He was the ugliest man I have ever seen."
"I never met him," said Sir Bliant.
"It was proved that Lancelot ran mad in his shirt and breeches, until he got gored by a wild boar and died in a hermitage." "When was that?" "Last Christmas."
"It was about the same time that my Wild Man ran away with the hunt. Ours was a boar hunt too."
"Well," said King Pelles, "they may have been the same person. If they were, it is interesting. How did your fellow arrive?"
"It was during the summer questing, the year before last. I had my pavilion pitched in a fair meadow, in the usual way, and I was inside it, waiting for something to turn up. I was playing chess, I remember. Then there was a frightful row outside, and I went out, and there was this naked lunatic lashing on my shield. My dwarf was sitting on the ground, rubbing his neck-- the maniac had half broken it --and he was calling out for help. I went to the fellow and said: 'Look here, my good man, you don't want to be fighting me. Come now, you lay down that sword and be a good chap.' He had got hold of one of my own swords, you know, and I could see that he was mad straightway. I said: 'You ought not to be fighting, old boy. I can see mat what you need is a good sleep and something to eat.' And, really, he did look dreadful. He was like a man who had been watching a passager for three nights. His eyeballs were bright red."
"What did he say?"
"He just said: 'As for that, come not too nigh: for, an thou do, wit thou well I will slay thee.'" "Strange."
"Yes, it was strange, wasn't it? That he should have known the high language, I mean." "What did he do?"
"Well, I was only in my gown, and the man looked dangerous. I went back into the pavilion and did on my armour."
King Pelles handed him another pasty, which Sir Bliant accepted with a nod.
"When I was armed," he went on, with his mouth full, "I went out with a spare sword to disarm the chap. I did not intend to strike him, or anything like that, but he was a homicidal maniac and there was no other way of getting the sword from him. I went up to him like you do to a dog, holding out my hand and saying: "There's a poor fellow: come now, there's a good chap.' I thought it would be easy."
"Was it?"
"The moment he saw me in armour, and with a sword, he came straight at me like a tiger. I never saw such an attack. I tried to parry a bit, and I dare say I would have killed him in self- defence, if he had given me a chance. But the next thing I knew was that I was sitting on the ground, and my nose and ears were bleeding. He had given me a bufiet, you know, which troubled my brains."
"Goodness," said King Pelles.
"The next thing he did was to throw away his sword and rush straight into the pavilion. My poor wife was there, in bed, with no clothes on. But he just jumped straight into bed with her, snatched the coverlet, rolled himself up in it, and went fast asleep."
"Must have been a married man," said King Pelles.
"The wife gave some frightful shrieks, hopped out of bed on the other side, jumped into her smock, and came running out to me. I was still a bit astonied, lying on the ground, so she thought I was dead. I can tell you we had a fine to-do."
"Did he sleep right through it?"
"He slept like a log. We managed to pull ourselves together eventually, and the wife put one of my gauntlets down my neck to stop the nosebleed, and then we talked it over. My dwarf, who is a splendid little chap, said we ought not to do him any harm, because he was touched by God. As a matter of fact, it was the dwarf who suggested that he might be Sir Lancelot. There was a good deal of talk about the Lancelot mystery that year."
Sir Bliant paused to take another bite.
"In the end," he said, "we took him to Castle Bliant in a horse litter, bed and all. He never stirred. When we got him there, we tied his hands and feet against the hour when he would wake up. I am sorry about it now, but we could not chance it according to what we knew at the time. We kept him in a comfortable room, with clean clothes, and the wife gave him a lot of nourishing food, to build up his strength, but we thought it best to keep him handcuffed all
the same. We kept him for a year and a half."
"How did he get away?"
"I was coming to that. It is the plum of the story. One afternoon I was out in the forest tor half an hour's questing, when I was set upon by two knights from behind." "Two knights?" asked the King. "From behind?" "Yes. Two of them, and from behind. It was Sir Bruce Saunce Pit and a friend of his." King Pelles thumped his knee.
"That man," he exclaimed, "is a public menace. I can't think why somebody doesn't do away with him."
"The trouble is to catch the fellow. However, I was telling you about the Wild Man. Sir Bruce and the other one had me at a considerable disadvantage, as you will admit, and I regret to say that I was compelled to run away."
Sir Bliant stopped and gazed into the fire. Then he cheered up.
"Ah, well," he said, "we can't all be heroes, can we?" "Not all," said King Pelles.
"I was sore wounded," said Sir Bliant, discovering a formula, "and I felt myself faint." "Quite."
"These two came galloping with me all the way to the Castle, one on either side, and they kept hitting me all the time. I don't know to this day how I got away with my life." "It was written in the Stones," said the King. "We rode past the barbican loopholes, hell-for-leather, and it was there that the Wild Man must have seen us. We kept him in the barbican chamber, you know. Well, he saw us at all events, and we found out afterwards that he broke his fetters with his bare hands. They were iron fetters, and he had them on his ankles also. He wounded himself dreadfully doing it. Then he came hurling out of the postern, with his hands all bloody and the chains flying about him, and he pulled Brace's ally out of the saddle, and took
his sword from him, and walloped Bruce on the head so that he knocked him noseling, clean off his horse. The second knight tried to stab the Wild Man from behind--he was absolutely unarmed--but I cut off the fellow's hand at the wrist, just as he stabbed. Then the both of them caught their horses, and rode away for all they were fit. They rode more than a pace, I can tell you." "That was Brace all over."
"My brother was staying with me that year. I said to him: 'Why ever have we kept this dear fellow chained up?" I was ashamed when I saw his wounded hands. 'He is happy and gracious,' I said, 'and now he has saved my life. We must never chain him up, again, but give him his freedom and do everything we can for him.' You know, Pelles, I liked that Wild Man. He was gentle and grateful, and he used to call me Lord. It is a dreadful thing to think that he might have been the great Dulac, and us keeping nun tied up and letting him call me Lord so humbly."
"What happened in the end?"
"He stayed quietly for several months. Then the boar hounds came to the castle, and one of the followers left his horse and spear by a tree. The Wild Man took them and rode away. It
was as if he were excited by gentlemanly pursuits, you know--as if a suit of armour, or a fight, or a hunt, stirred something in his poor head. They made him want to join in."
"Poor boy," said the King. "Poor, poor boy! It might well have been Sir Lancelot. He is known to have been killed by a boar last Christmas."
"I should like to know that story."
"If your man was Lancelot, he rode straightaway after the boar they were hunting. It was a famous boar which had troubled the hounds for several years, and that was why the field was not on foot. Lancelot was the only man up at the kill, and the boar slew his horse. It gave him a dreadful wound in the thigh, riving him to the hough bone, before he cut off its head. He killed it near a hermitage, with one blow. The hermit came out, but Lancelot was so mad with his pain and everything that he threw his sword at the man. I heard this from a knight who was actually there. He said there was no doubt about its being Sir Lancelot--he was ugly and all that--and he said that he and the hermit carried him into the hermitage after he had fainted. He said that nobody could possibly have recovered from the wound, and that, in any case, he saw him die. What made him most certain, he said, about the Wild Man being a great knight, was that when he was standing in his death agony beside the dead boar, he spoke to the hermit as 'Fellow'. So you see, there may have been a touch of sanity at the end."
"Poor Lancelot," said Sir Bliant.
"God be good to him," said King Pelles.
"Amen."
"Amen," repeated Sir Bliant, looking into the fire. Then he stood up and shook his shoulders. "I shall have to be going," he said. "How is your daughter? I forgot to ask."
King Pelles sighed, and stood up also.
"She spends her time at the convent," he said. "I believe she is going to be received next year. However, we are to be allowed to see her next Saturday, when she comes home on a short visit."
20 After Sir Btiant had ridden away, King Pelles stumped upstairs to do some biblical genealogy. He was puzzled about the Lancelot affair, and interested in it on account of his grandson Galahad. All of us have been driven nearly mad by oar wives and sweethearts, but King Pelles was aware, that there is a tough streak in human nature which generally prevents us from being quite driven. He thought it eccentric of Lancelot, to say the least, to lose his reason over a lover's tiff--and he wanted to find out, by looking up the Ban genealogy, whether there had been a streak of lunacy in the family which could account for it If there were, it might descend on Galahad. The child might have to be sent to the hospital of Bethlehem, which later ages were to call Bedlam. There had been enough trouble without that.
"Ban's father," said King Pelles to himself, polishing his spectacles and blowing dust off
numerous works of Heraldry, Genealogy, Nigromancy, and Mystical Mathematics, "was King Lancelot of Benwick, who married the King of Ireland's daughter. King Lancelot's father, in his turn, was Jonas, who married the daughter of Manuel of Gaul. Now who was the father of Jonas?"
When one comes to think of it, there may have been a weak link in Lancelot's mind. This may have been the cupboard skeleton we noticed, ten years ago, at the back of the small boy's head as he turned the kettle-hat to and fro, in the Armoury of Beowick Castle.
"Nacien," said King Pelles. "Drat this Nacien. There seem to be two of him."
He had got back, through Lisais, Hellias le Grose, Nacien the Hermit--from whom Lancelot probably inherited his visionary tendency--and Nappus, to a second Nacien, who, if he existed, would quite upset the King's theory that Lancelot was but the eighth degree from Our Lord. As a matter of fact, nearly all hermits seemed to be called Nacien in those days.
"Drat him," repeated the King, and he glanced out of the window to see what the noise was about in the street outside the castle.
A Wild Man--there seemed to be a lot of them about this morning--was being run through Corbin by the villagers who had once gone out to welcome Lancelot. He was naked, as thin as a ghost, and he ran along with his hands over his head, to protect it. The small boys running all round him were throwing turfs at him. He stopped every now and then, and caught one of the boys and threw him over the hedge. This only made the boys throw stones. King Pelles could clearly see the blood running over his high cheek-bones, and the sunken cheeks, and the hunted eyes, and the blue shadows between bis ribs. He could also see that the man was making for the castle.
In the castle yard, when King Pelles had gone dot-and-carry downstairs, there was quite a crowd of castle folk standing round the Wild Man in admiration. They had lowered the
portcullis, to keep the village boys out, and they were disposed to treat the fugitive with kindness.
"Look at his wounds," said one of the squires. "Look at that great scar there. Perhaps he was a knight errant before he went mad, and so we ought to give him courtesy."
The Wild Man stood in the middle of the ring, while the ladies giggled and the pages pointed. He hung his head and stood motionless, without speaking, waiting for what was to be done to him next.
"Perhaps he is Sir Lancelot."
There was a great laugh at this.
"No, but seriously. It was never exactly proved that Lancelot is dead."
King Pelles went right up to the Wild Man and looked into his face. He had to stoop sideways to do this.
"Are you Sir Lancelot?" he asked.
The emaciated, dirty, bearded facet its eyes never even blinked.
"Are you?" repeated the King. But there was no answer from the dummy. "He is deaf and dumb," said the King. "We will keep him as a jester. He looks funny enough, I must say. Somebody get the man some clothes--you know, comic clothes--and put him to sleep in the pigeon house. Give him some clean straw."
The dummy suddenly lifted both its hands and let out a roar, which made everybody start back. The King dropped his spectacles. Then it lowered its hands again and stood sheepishly, so that the people gave a nervous giggle.
"Better lock him in," said the King wisely. "Safety first. And do not hand him his food-- throw it to him. Can't be too careful."
So Sir Lancelot was led away to the pigeon house, to be King Pelles' fool--and there he was locked in, and fed by throwing, and lodged on clean straw.
When the King's nephew, a boy called Castor, came to be knighted on the following Saturday--this was the ceremony which Elaine was coming home to attend--there was gaiety in the castle. The King, who was addicted to festivals and ceremonials of all sorts, celebrated the occasion royally, by presenting a new gown to every man on the estate. He also celebrated it, regrettably, by making too generous a use of the cellars over which Dame Brisen's husband presided. "Wossle," cried the King.
"Drink hail," replied Sir Castor, who was on his best behaviour.
"Everybody gotter gown?" shouted the King. "Yes, thank you, Your Majesty," replied the attendants. "Sure?"
"Quite sure, Your Majesty." "Thas alri, then. Goo' ole gown!" And the King wrapped himself in his own gown with great affection. He was a different man on occasions like this.
"Everybody wants to thank Your Majesty very much for his generous present." "Notter tall."
"Three cheers for King Pelles," "Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!"
"Warrabout the fool?" inquired the King suddenly. "Fool gotter gown? Where's the pore fool?"
There was a silence at this, for nobody had remembered to put a gown aside for Sir Lancelot.
"Notter gown? Nottergotter gown?" cried the King. "Fesha fool at once."
Sir Lancelot was fetched from the pigeon house, for the royal favour. He stood still in the torchlight with some straws in his beard, a pitiful figure in his jester's patchwork.
"Pore fool," said the King sadly. "Pore fool. Here, have mine."
And, in spite of all remonstrances and advices to the contrary, King Pelles struggled out of his costly robe, which he popped over Lancelot's head.
"Lettim loose," cried the King. "Givim holly-holly day. Karnkeepamanlocktupforever."
Sir Lancelot, standing upright in the grand dress, looked strangely stately in the Great Hall. If only his beard had been trimmed--our clean-shaven generation has forgotten what a difference the trimming of a beard can make--if only he had not starved away to a skeleton in the cell of the poor hermit after the boar hunt--if only he had not been rumoured to be dead--but, even as it was, a sort of awe came into the Hall. The King did not notice it. With measured tread Sir Lancelot walked back to his pigeon loft, and the house carls made an avenue for him as he went.
21 Elaine had done the ungraceful thing as usual. Guenever, in similar circumstances, would have been sure to grow pale and interesting--but Elaine had only grown plump. She walked in the castle garden with her companions, dressed in the white clothes of a novice, and there was a clumsy action in her walk. Galahad, now three years old, walked with her, holding hands.
It was not that Elaine was going to be a nun because she was desperate. She was not going to spend the rest of her life acting the cinema nun. A woman can forget a lot of love in two years--or at any rate she can pack it away, and grow accustomed to it, and hardly remember it more than a business-man might remember an occasion when, by ill-lack, he failed, to make an investment which would have made him a millionaire.
Elaine was going to leave her son and become the bride of Christ, because she saw that this was the only thing to do. It was not a dramatic thing, and perhaps it was not very reverent-- but she kaew that she would never again love any human person as she had loved her dead knight. So she was giving in. She could not tack against the wind any longer.
She was not moping for Lancelot, nor did she weep for him on her pillow. She hardly ever thought of him. He had worn a place for himself in some corner of her heart, as a sea shell, always boring against the rock, might do. The making of the place had been her pain. But now the shell was safely in the rock. It was lodged, and ground no longer. Elaine, walking in the garden with her girls, thought only about the ceremony at which Sir Castor had been knighted, and whether there would be enough, cakes for the feast, and that Galahad's stockings needed mending.
One of the girls who had been playing a kind of ball game to keep warm--the same game as Nausicaa was playing when Ulysses arrived--came running back to Elaine from the shrubbery by the well. Her ball had taken her in that direction.
"There is a Man," she whispered, much as if it had been a rattlesnake. "There is a Man, sleeping by the well!"
Elaine was interested--not because it was a man, nor because the girl was frightened, but because it was unusual to sleep out of doors in January. "Hush, then," said Elaine. "We will go and see." The plump novice in the white clothes who tiptoed over to Lancelot, the homely
girl going composedly towards him with a round face which had stubbornly refused to accept the noble traces of grief, the young matron who had been thinking about Galahad's mending--this person was not conscious of vulnerability or needs. She went over calmly and innocently, busy about quite different concerns, like the thoughtless rabbit who goes hop-and- nibble along the accustomed path. But the wire loop tightens suddenly.
Elaine recognized Lancelot in two heartbeats. The first beat was a rising one which faltered at the top. The second one caught up with it, picked its momentum from the crest of the wave, and both came down together like a rearing horse that falls.
Lancelot was stretched out in his knightly gown. Sir Bliant, in remarking that gentlemanly things seemed to stir something in his head, had noticed truly. Moved by the gown, by some strange memory of miniver and colour, the poor Wild Man had gone from the King's table to the well. There, alone in the darkness, without a mirror, he had washed his face. He had swilled out his eye sockets with bony knuckles. With a currycomb and a pair" of shears from the stables he had tried to arrange his hair.
Elaine sent her women away. She gave Galahad's hand to one of them, and he went without protest. He was a mysterious child.
Elaine knelt down beside Sir Lancelot and looked at him. She did not touch him or cry. She lifted her hand to stroke his thin one, but thought better of it. She squatted on her hams. Then, after a long time, she did begin to cry--but it was for Lancelot, for his tired eyes smoothed in sleep, and for the white scars on his hands.
"Father," said Elaine, "if you don't help me now, nobody ever can."
"What is it, my dear?" asked the King. "I have a headache."
Elaine paid no attention.
"Father, I have found Sir Lancelot."
"Who?"
"Sir Lancelot."
"Nonsense," said the King. "Lancelot was killed by a boar."
"He is asleep in the garden."
The King suddenly pulled himself out of his chair of state.
"I knew it all along," he said. "Only I was too stupid to know. It is the Wild Man. Obviously."
He reeled a little and put his hand to his head.
"Leave this to me," said the King. "You let me deal. I know exactly what to do. Butler! Brisen! Where the devil has everybody gone to? Hi! Hi! Oh, there you are. Now, butler, you go and fetch your wife, Dame Brisen, and get two other men that we can trust. Let me see.
Get Humbert and Gurth. Where did you say he was?" "Asleep by the well," said Elaine quickly. "Quite. So everybody must be told to keep out of the rose garden. Do you hear, butler? All people are to avoid, that none may be in the way where the King will come. And get a sheet. A strong sheet. We shall have to carry him in it, by the four corners. And get the tower room ready. Tell Brisen to air the bedclothes. Better have a feather bed. Light a fire, and fetch the doctor. Tell him to look up Madness in Bartholomews Anglicus. Oh, and you had better get some jellies made, and things like that. In the heaviness of his sleep we shall have to put fresh garments on him."
The next time he woke they could see that his eyes were clear. But he was evidently in a pitiful state of mind. He was relying on them to save him.
The third time he woke, he said: "O Lord Jesus, how did I get here?"
They said the usual things about resting now, and not talking till he was stronger, and so forth. The doctor waved his hand to the Royal Orchestra, who immediately struck up with Jesu Christes Milde Moder--since Dr. Bartholomew's book had recommended that madmen should be gladded with instruments. Everybody watched hopefully, to see the effect, but Lancelot grabbed the King's hand and cried in anguish: "For God's sake, my lord, tell me how I came here?"
Elaine put her band on his forehead and made him lie down.
"You came like a madman," she said, "and nobody knew who you were. You have been having a breakdown." Lancelot turned his puzzled eyes on her, and smiled nervously.
"I have been making a fool of myself," he said. Later he asked: "Did many people see me while I was mad?"
22 Lancelot's body revenged itself on his mind. He lay in bed for a fortnight in the airy bedroom with an ache in every bone, while Elaine kept herself outside the room. She had him at her mercy, and could have nursed him day and night. But there was something in her heart-- either decency, or pride, or generosity, or humility, or the determination not to be a cannibal--which spared him. She visited him not more than once a day, and thrust nothing on him.
One day he stopped her as she was going out. He was sitting up in a day-gown, and his hands lay still in his lap.
"Elaine," he said, "I suppose I ought to be making plans."
She waited for her sentence.
"I cannot stay here for ever," he said.
"You know you will be welcome as long as you like."
"I cannot go back to court."
Elaine remarked, with hesitation: "My father would give you a castle, if you like, and we-- could live there together."
He looked at her, and looked away.
"Or you could have the castle."
Lancelot took her hand and said: "Elaine, I don't know what to say. I can't very well say anything."
"I know you don't love me."
"Do you think we should be happy, then?"
"I only know when I shall be unhappy."
"I don't want you to be unhappy. But there are different ways of being that. Don't you think it might turn out that you would be more unhappy if we lived together?"
"I should be the happiest woman in the world."
"Look, Elaine, our only hope is to speak plainly, even if it sounds horrible. You know that I don't love you, and that I do love the Queen. It is an accident which has happened and it can't be changed. Things do happen like that: I can't alter it. And you have trapped me twice. If it had not been for you, I should still be at court. Do you think we could ever be happy, living together, like that?"
"You were my man," said Elaine proudly, "before you were ever the Queen's." He passed a hand over his eyes. "Do you want to have a husband on those terms?" "There is Galahad," said Elaine. They sat side by side, looking into the fire. She did not cry or bid for pity--and he knew she was sparing him these things.
He said, with difficulty: "I will stay with you, Elaine, if you want me to. I don't understand why you should want it. I am fond of you, very fond of you. I don't know why, after what has happened. I don't want you to be hurt. But, Elaine--I can't marry you." "I don't mind."
"It is because--it is because marriage is a contract. I--I have always been proud of my Word. And if I do not--and if I have not that feeling for you--hang it, Elaine, I am under no obligation to marry you, when it was you who tricked me."
"No obligation."
"Obligation!" exclaimed Lancelot, with a wry face. He threw the word into the fire as if it had a bad taste. "I must be sure that you understand, and that I am not cheating you. I will not marry you, because I do not love you. I did not start this, and I can't give you my freedom: I can't promise to stay with you for ever. I don't want you to accept these terms, Elaine: they are humiliating ones. They are dictated by the circumstances. If I were to say anything else it would be lies, and things would be worse--"
He broke off and hid his head in his hands. "I don't understand," he, said. "I am trying to do my best."
Elaine said: "Under any terms, you are my good and gracious lord."
King Pelles gave them a castle which was already known to Sir Lancelot. The King's tenant, Sir Bliant, had to move out to make room for them--which he did the more readily when he knew that he was obliging the Wild Man who had saved his life.
"Is he Sir Lancelot?" asked Bliant.
"No," said King Pelles. "He is a French knight who calls himself the Chevalier Mai Fet. I told you I was right about Sir Lancelot being dead."
It had been arranged that Lancelot was to live incognito --because, if it were allowed to get about that he was still living and lodged at Bliant Castle, there would only be a hue-and-cry for him from the court.
Bliant Castle had such a fine moat that it was practically an island. The only way to get to it was by boat, from a barbican on the land side, and the castle itself was surrounded by a magic fence of iron, probably a sort of cheval de frise. Ten knights were appointed to serve Lancelot there, and twenty ladies to serve Elaine. She was wild with joy.
"We will call it the Joyous Island," she said. "We shall be so happy there. And, Lance"--he flinched when she called him by the pet name--"I want you to have your hobbies. We must have tournaments, and hawking, and plenty of things to do. You must invite people to stay, so that we can have company. I promise I won't be jealous of you, Lance, and I won't try to live
in your pocket. Don't you think we might have a happy time if we are careful? Don't you think the Joyous Isle would be a lovely name?"
Lancelot cleared his throat and said: "Yes, it would be an excellent one."
"You must have a new shield made for you, so that you can go on with your tournaments without being recognized. What sort of blazon will you have?"
"Anything," said Lancelot. "We can arrange that later." "The Chevalier Mai Fet. What a romantic name! What does it mean?"
"You could make it mean several things. The Ugly Knight would be one meaning, or the Knight Who Has Done Wrong."
He did not tell her that it could also mean the Ill-Starred Knight--the Knight with a Curse on Him. "I don't think you are ugly--or wrong." Lancelot pulled himself together. He knew that it would be most unfair to stay with Elaine if he were going to mope about it, or to do the Grand Renunciation--but, on the other hand, it was empty work to pretend.
"That is because you are a darling," he said. He kissed her quickly and clumsily, to cover the crack in the word. But Elaine noticed it.
"You will be able to attend to Galahad's education personally," she said. "You will be able to teach him all your tricks, so that he grows up to be the greatest knight in the world."
He kissed her again. She had said, "If we are careful," and she was trying to be careful. He felt pity for her trying, and gratitude for the decency of her mind. He was like a distracted man doing two things at once, one of them important and the other unimportant. He felt a duty to the unimportant one. But it is always embarrassing to be loved. And he did not like to accept Elaine's humility because of his opinion of himself.
The morning when they were to set out for Bliant arrived, and the newly-made knight, Sir Castor, stopped Lancelot in the Hall. He was only seventeen.
"I know you are calling yourself the Ill-Made Knight," said Sir Castor, "but I think you are Sir Lancelot. Are you?"
Lancelot took the boy by the arm.
"Sir Castor," he said, "do you think that is a knightly question? Suppose I were Sir Lancelot, and was only calling myself the Chevalier Mai Fet--don't you think I might have some reasons for doing that, reasons which a gentleman of lineage ought to respect?"
Sir Castor blushed very much and knelt on one knee. "I won't tell anybody," he said. Nor did he.
23 The spring vame slowly, the new menage settled down, and Elaine arranged a tournament for her cavalier. There was to be a prize of a fair maid and a jerfalcon.
Five hundred knights came from all parts of the kingdom to compete in the tournament--but the Chevalier Mal Fet knocked down anybody who would stand up to him, with a kind of absent-minded ferocity, and the thing was a failure. The knights went away puzzled and frightened. Not a single person had been killed--he spared everybody indifferently as soon as he had knocked them down--and, by the Chevalier at any rate, not a single word had been spoken. The defeated knights, jogging home with their bruises, missed the conviviality which usually happened on tournament evenings, wondered who the taciturn champion could be, and talked superstitiously among thelmselves. Elaine, smiling bravely until the last of them had gone, went up to her room and cried. Then she dried her eyes and set out to find her lord. He had vanished as soon as the fighting was over, for he had got into the habit of going away by himself at sunset every evening--she did not know where.
She found him on the battlements, in a blaze of gold. Their shadows, and the shadow of the tower on which they stood, and all the spectres of the burning trees, stretched over the parkland in broad strips of indigo. He was looking towards Camelot with desperate eyes. His new shield, with the blazon of his incognito, was propped in front of him. The cognizance was of a silver woman on a sable field, with a knight kneeling at her feet.
In her simplicity, Elaine had been delighted by the compliment on the shield. She had never been clever. Now she realized, for the first time, that the silver woman was crowned. She stood helplessly, wondering what she could do--but there was nothing she could do. Her
weapons were blunt ones, of soft metal. She could only use patience and self-restraint, poor tools when matched against the heartfelt mania of love to which the ancient race was martyred.
One morning they were sitting on a green bank at the edge of the lake. Elaine was doing embroidery, while Lancelot watched his son. Galahad, a priggish, mute little boy, was playing some private game with his dolls--to which he remained attached long after most boys would have taken to soldiers. Lancelot had carved two knights in armour for him out of wood. They were mounted on wheeled horses, from which they were detachable, and they held their spears in fewter. By pulling the horses towards each other, with strings tied to the platform on which they stood, the knights could be made to tilt. They could be made to knock each other out of the saddle. Galahad did not care for them at all, but played with a rag doll which he called the Holy Holy. "Gwyneth will ruin that sparrow hawk," remarked Lancelot.
They could see one of the castle gentlewomen coming towards them at a great pace, with the sparrow hawk on her fist. Her haste had excited the hawk, which was bating continuously-- but Gwyneth paid no attention to it, beyond giving it an occasional angry shake.
"What is the matter, Gwyneth?"
"Oh, my lady, there are two knights waiting beyond the water, and they say they have come to tilt with the Chevalier."
"Tell them to go away," said Lancelot. "Say I am not at home."
"But, sir, the porter has told them the way to the boat, and they are coming over one at a time. They say they won't both come, but the second will come if you beat the first. He is in the boat already."
He got up and dusted his knees.
"Tell him to wait in the tilt yard," he said. "I will be twenty minutes."
The tilt yard was a long, sanded passage between the walls, with a tower at each end. It had galleries looking down on it from the walls, like a racquets court, and was open to the sky. Elaine and the domestics sat in these galleries to watch, and the two knights fought beneath them for a long time. The tilting was even--each of them had a fall-- and the sword-play lasted for two hours. At the end of this time, the strange knight cried: "Stop!"
Lancelot stopped at once, as if he were a farm labourer who had been given permission to knock off for his dinner. He stuck his sword in the ground, as if it were a pitchfork, and stood patiently. He had, indeed, only been working with the quiet patience of a farm hand. He had not been trying to hurt his opponent.
"Who are you?" asked the stranger. "Please tell me your name? I have never met a man like you."
Lancelot suddenly lifted both gauntlets to his helm, as if he were trying to bury in them the face which was already hidden, and said miserably: "I am Sir Lancelot Dulac."
"What!"
"I am Lancelot, Degalis."
Degalis threw his sword against the stone wall with a clang, and began running back towards the tower by the moat. His iron feet threw echoes down the yard. He unlaced and tossed away his helm as he ran. When he had reached the portcullis of the gate-house, he put his hands to his mouth and shouted with all his might: "Ector! Ector! It is Lancelot! Come over!" Immediately he was running back towards his friend. "Lancelot! My dear, dear fellow! I was sure it was you, I was sure it was you!"
He began fumbling with the laces, trying to get the helm off with clumsy fingers. He snatched off his own gauntlets and hurled them, too, with a clash against the wall. He could hardly wait to see Sir Lancelot's face. Lancelot stood still, like a tired child being undressed.
"But what have you been doing? Why are you here? It was feared that you were dead."
The helm came off, and went to join the rest of the discards.
"Lancelot!"
"Did you say that Ector was with you?" "Yes, it is your brother Ector. We have been looking for you for two years. Oh, Lancelot, I am glad to see you!" "You must come in," he said, "and refresh yourselves." "But what have you been doing all this time? Where have you been
hidden? The Queen sent out three knights to search for you at the beginning. In the end there were twenty-three of us. It must have cost her twenty thousand pounds."
"I have been here and there."
"Even the Orkney faction helped. Sir Gawaine is one of the searchers."
By this time Sir Ector had arrived in the boat--Sir Ector Demaris, not King Arthur's guardian--and the portcullis had been raised for him. He ran for the Chevalier, as if he were to tackle him at football. "Brother!"
Elaine had come down from her gallery and was waiting at the end of the tilt yard. She was now to welcome, as she knew well, the people who were to break her heart. She did not interfere with their greetings, but watched them like a child who had been left out of a game. She stood still, gathering her forces. All her powers, all the frontier guards of her spirit, were being called in and concentrated at the citadel of her heart.
"This is Elaine."
They turned to her and began to bow.
"You are welcome to Bliant Castle."
24
"I can't leave Elaine," he said.
Ector Demaris said: "Why not? You don't love her. You are under no obligation to her. You are only making yourselves miserable by staying together."
"I am under an obligation to her. I can't explain it, but I am."
"The Queen," said Degalis, "is desperate. She has spent a fortune looking for you." "I can't help that."
"It is no good sulking," said Ector. "It seems to me that you are sulking. If the Queen is sorry for what she has done, whatever it was, you ought to behave generously and forgive her."
"I have nothing to forgive the Queen." "That is just what I say. You ought to go back to court and follow your career. For one thing, you owe it to Arthur: don't forget that you are one of his sworn knights. He has been needing you badly." "Needing me?"
"There is the usual trouble with the Orkneys." "What have the Orkneys been doing? Oh, Degalis, you don't know how it does my heart good to hear the old names. Tell me all the gossip. Has Kay been making a fool of himself lately? Is Binadan still laughing? What is the news about Tristram and King Mark?"
"If you are so keen about the news, you ought to come back to court." "I have told you I can't"
"Lancelot, you are not looking at this realistically. Do you seriously think you can stay here incognito with this wench, and still be yourself? Do you think you can beat five hundred knights in a tournament without being recognized?"
"The moment we heard about the tournament," said Ector, "we came at once. Degalis said: That is Lancelot, or I'm a Dutchman.'"
"It would mean," said Degalis, "if you insist on staying here, that you would have to give up arms altogether. One more fight, and you would be known all over the country. For that matter, I think you are known already."
"Staying with Elaine would mean giving up everything. It would mean absolute retirement-- no quests, no tournaments, no honour, no love: and you might even have to stay indoors all day. Yours is not an easy face to forget, you know."
"Whatever it means, Elaine is kind and good. Ector, when people trust you and depend on you, you can't hurt them. You could not treat a dog so."
"People don't marry dogs, however."
"Damn it, this girl loves me."
"So does the Queen."
Lancelot turned the cap round in his hands.
"The last time I saw the Queen," he said, "she told me never to come near her again."
"But she has spent twenty thousand pounds looking for you."
He waited for some time and then asked, in a voice which sounded rough: "Is she well?"
"She is absolutely wretched."
Ector said: "She knows it was her fault. She cried a great deal, and Bors told her she was a fool, but she didn't argue with him. Arthur is wretched too, because the whole Table is upside down."
Lancelot threw his cap on the ground and stood up.
"I told Elaine," he said, "that I would not promise to stay with her: so I must."
"Do you love her?" asked Degalis, cutting to the root.
"Yes, I do. She has been good to me. I am fond of her."
At their looks, he changed the word.
"I love her," he said defiantly.
The knights had been staying for a week, and Lancelot, listening hungrily to their Table news, was weakening every day. Elaine, sitting at the high table beside her lord at dinner, lived in a flow of conversation about people whose names she had never heard and about events which she could not understand. There was nothing to do except to offer second helpings, which Ector would accept without interrupting the anecdote of the moment They leaned across her and talked and laughed, and Elaine busily laughed too. Every day Lancelot went to his turret at sunset--she had tiptoed away when she first found him there, and he did not know it was a discovered rendezvous.
"Lancelot," she said one morning, "there is a man waiting on the other side of the moat, with a horse and armour." "A knight?"
"No. He looks like a squire."
"I wonder who it can be this time. Tell the porter to fetch him across."
"The porter says he won't come across. He says he will wait there for Sir Lancelot." "I will go and see."
Elaine detained him as he went down to the boat. "Lancelot," she said, "what do you want me to do with Galahad, if you should go away?" "Go away? Who says I am going away?" "Nobody has said so, but I want to know." "I don't understand what you are talking about." "I want to know how Galahad is to be brought up." "Well, I suppose in the usual way. He will learn to be a good knight, I hope. But the whole question is imaginary." "That is what I wanted to know." She detained him once more, however. "Lancelot, will you tell me one
other thing? If you should go away, if you should have to leave me--would you be coming back?"
"I have told you that I am not going away." She was trying the meaning of her words, as she made them, like a man walking slowly over a bog and feeling in front of him as he went.
"It would help me to go on with Galahad--it would help me to go on living--if I knew that it was for something--if I knew that one day--if I knew that you would be coming back."
"Elaine, I don't know why you are talking like this."
"I am not trying to stop you, Lance. Perhaps it will be best for you to go. Perhaps it is a thing which has to happen. Only, I wanted to know if I should see you again-- because it is important to me."
He took her hands.
"If I go," he said, "I will come back."
The man on the other side of the moat was Uncle Dap. He was standing with Lancelot's old charger, now two years older, and all his accustomed armour neatly stowed on the saddle, as if for a kit inspection. Everything was correctly folded and strapped in the proper military place. The habergeon was rolled in a tight bundle. The helm, pauldrons, and vambraces were polished, literally by weeks of polishing, to that veneer or patina of light which is to be found only on things bought newly from the shop before they have been dulled by household
cleaning. There was a smell of saddle soap, mixed with the unmistakable, personal smell of armour--as individual a smell as that which you get in the professional's shop on a golf course, and, to a knight, as exciting.
All Lancelot's muscles made an empathic sortie towards the feeling of his own armour, which he had not seen since he left Camelot. His forefinger felt where the handle of his sword would use it for a fulcrum. His thumb knew the exact weight in ounces which it would have to exert on the near side of the fulcrum. The pad on the inside of his palm lusted for the gripe of the hilt. His whole arm remembered the balance of Joyeux and wanted to wag him in the air.
Uncle Dap looked older, and would not speak. He only held the bridle and displayed the gear, waiting for the knight to mount and ride. His stern eye, as fierce as a goshawk's, waited on his charge. He held out the great tilting helm silently, with its familiar panache of heron hackles and the silver thread.
Lancelot took the helm from Uncle Dap, with both hands, and turned it round. His hands knew the weight to expect --exactly twenty-two and a half pounds. He saw the superb polish, the fresh padding, and the new mantling set behind. It was of azure sarsenet, hand- embroidered in gold thread with the numerous small fleur-de-lis of ancient France. He knew at once whose fingers had done the embroidery. He lifted the helm to his nose and sniffed the mantling.
Immediately she was there--not the Guenever whom he had remembered on the battlements,
but the real Jenny, in a different posture, with every lash of her eyelids and every pore of her skia and every note of her voice and every articulation of her smile.
He did not look back as he rode away from Bliant Castle--and Elaine, standing on the barbican tower, did not wave. She watched him going with a still-struck concentration, like somebody who, shipwrecked, gets as much fresh water into the little boat as possible. She had a few seconds left, to make her store of Lancelot that must last her through the years. There would be only this store, and their son, and a lot of gold. He had left her all his money, enough to bring a thousand pounds a year for life--in those days a huge sum.
25 Fifteen years after leaving Elaine, Lancelot was still at court. The King's relations with Guenever and her lover were much as they had always been. The great difference was that everybody was older. Lancelot's hair, which had already turned badger-grey when he first came back from his madness as a fellow of twenty-six, was quite white. Arthur's also was prematurely snowed--both men's lips were red in their silky nests of beard. Guenever alone had contrived to keep the raven on her head. She looked a splendid figure when she was forty.
Another difference was that a new generation had come to court. In their own hearts the chief characters of the Round Table felt the ardent feelings which they had always felt--but now they were figures instead of people. They were surrounded by younger clients for whom Arthur was not the crusader of a future day, but the accepted conqueror of a past one--for whom Lancelot was the hero of a hundred victories, and Guenever the romantic mistress of a nation.
To these young people, a sight of Arthur as he hunted in the greenwood was like seeing the idea of Royalty. They saw no man at all, but England. When Lancelot rode by, laughing at some private joke with the Queen, the commonalty were amazed that he could laugh. "Look," they would say to each other, "he is laughing, as if he were a vulgar person like ourselves. How condescending, how splendidly democratic of Sir Lancelot, to laugh, as if he were an ordinary man! Perhaps he eats and drinks as well, or even sleeps at night." But in their hearts the new generation was quite sure that the great Dulac did no such things.
Indeed, a lot of water had flowed under the bridges of Camelot in twenty-one years. They had been the years of building. When they began, they had been years of perrires and mangonels trundling along the rutty highways from one siege to another, to hurl destruction over castle walls--of movable wooden towers on wheels, going lumbering against recreant keeps, so that the archers, shooting down from the top of them, could throw death into treacherous strongholds--of companies of engineers marching along in clouds of summer dust, their picks and shovels on their shoulders, to undermine revolted bartizans so that the great stones caved and fell tottering. When Arthur had been unable to take a strong-arm castle by assault, he had caused tunnels to be dug under selected parts of the wall. These tunnels, being supported on beams of wood which could be burned away with fire at the proper moment, had collapsed, bringing the rubble-filled baileys down on top of them.
The early years had been times of battle, in which those who insisted on living by the sword had been made to die by it. They had been years lit by whole towersful of combatants roasting like so many Guy Fawkes--for the great objection to a pele tower as a stronghold

The path, to Avalon!
I care not for my seat in the twelve.
The mysterious Aval Organization was a secret group with origins rooted in ancient times. They say the group came to be when a king used the spirit sword to defeat its cursed counterpart, and with his dying breath, entrusted them with both the blade and his unfinished mission. Each new generation has taken on the group’s mission to rid the world of "Outsiders"—those connected with the cursed sword.

One such member was Grøh, about whom little is known save for that he was a fearsome warrior. Though his fighting style is shrouded in mystery, he is believed to have wielded two swords. Some also say he kept a certain technique close to his chest…

The Aval Organization’s top priority was terminating the wielder of Soul Edge, Nightmare. Even though they employed the ace up their sleeve in the form of Grøh, he was unable to accomplish his mission. Deeply wounded, he was pushed to the brink of death—the blow from Soul Edge had resulted in his soul being half-consumed by evil. And yet, he thought, perhaps he could use his terrible fate to fulfill his mission… He would control the evil within him, and only ever unleash it to the extent that he could maintain a grip on his own consciousness. Then, when his mission was complete, he would take his own life.

It was cold yet logical path, the only way he could envisage going forward. He would fight fire with fire. Unfortunately, righteousness can manifest itself in the cruelest of ways. When his friend was transformed into a Malfested, Grøh had no choice but to end his life with his own two hands. With the organization having fallen into chaos. Grøh felt the burden of responsibility squarely on his own shoulders. If only he had been able to subdue Nightmare, and do something about Azwel’s secession… And yet, despite his belief in the organization, the organization in return would never recognize him as one of their own, because the evil in his body made him an “Outsider.” He had to keep his condition a secret, or fearing losing his life.

Maintaining a delicate relationship with the Aval Organization, Grøh vowed to succeed in his latest mission: terminating Azwel…

With other members from the Aval Organization, Grøh followed Kilik and his companions as they headed west to face Nightmare. While the monk was alone, the warrior in black fought Kilik to test his strength. When Kilik seemingly passed the test, Grøh gave him information that Nightmare was based in Ostrheinsburg, and that Soul Edge was growing stronger. He then took his leave as Xianghua was approaching.

Later, when Kilik, Xianghua and Maxi were ambushed by Astaroth, Grøh arrived and offered to guide the first two to Ostrheinsburg. He then departed from them as they were about to enter the room where Nightmare was waiting.

Other Soul Chronicles
Just when Soul Edge was about to regain all of its power, Grøh infiltrated Ostrheinsburg but was caught by Astaroth. He lost to the golem and was forced to retreat.

Libra of Soul
Sometime after Azwel’s betrayal to the Aval Organization, Grøh pursued him to the east and encountered the Conduit and sensed their unusual powers. He then ordered Dion and Natalie to keep an eye on them. But Grøh ended up working alongside the Conduit to close many astral fissures scattered throughout Asia and Europe. Although they found Azwel in Fygul Cestemus’ underground temple, the researcher managed to escape and Grøh was ordered to find Kilik and attest his power.

After completing his mission, he rejoined the Conduit in Athens and found Azwel as he was about to unleash his Ultimate Seed. When his ally was defeated, Grøh unleashed his Malfestation and fought Azwel. The battle ended when the two of them fell into a deep ravine. Because he was Malfested, Grøh was considered an Outsider by the Aval Organization.

Over the next year, Grøh roamed the land as the Black Demon. He was eventually confronted by the Conduit, who made a promise to stop him if he became Malfested. Grøh’s fate is determined by two factors: the direction in which the Conduit’s spirit scale is leaning towards, and the sword they used to defeat Azwel. Grøh will either die by the Conduit’s hands and will be buried, or will be spared and makes a promise to his comrade to use his powers for good.

Grøh is usually a taciturn young man who is all about business, carrying out orders and missions with unwavering conviction. Despite his standoff-ish nature, he is not without emotion or compassion for others, particularly his allies Natalie and Dion and later the protagonist of Libra of Soul and served as a hero and inspiration to Aval as a whole. His relationship with the protagonist of Libra of Soul is noticeably much stronger; while initially suspicious of them, he grows to respect them, ultimately revealing to them not only his longing for home, but his most closely guarded secret of possessing malfested power, entrusting them to kill him should he lose his sanity. While Grøh hates outsiders, he is willing to test them to see whether or not they retain any shred of humanity. Grøh's usual business demeanor fades away completely whenever confronted with Azwel, his quiet tone erupting almost immediately into seething rage and contempt, ever since the incident involving the death of Curtis and the Aval’s leader Orzal. This anger manifests itself when Grøh willingly compromises his will in order to strike the said traitor down personally.

In the Good ending of Libra of Soul, Grøh feels indebted and very grateful towards the Conduit for saving him and hopes to live by their example to use his powers for something other than simply completing missions.

Aerondight Replica
Arondight, lauded as the pride of all knights, was wielded by many champions, and its power allowed them to achieve great deeds in battle. Alas, the sword has long been lost, and the one Grøh wield is an extremely well-made replica. That being said, it was forged using superlative techniques, and its sharpness equals if not surpasses the original.

The Aval Organization keeps many replicas of legendary swords such as Arondight, but insists that only one replica per sword be made. This is to ensure the swords remain symbols of the organization’s creed, pride, and glory. Accordingly, only the warriors whom the organization considers the best of the best to wield them. Arondight itself was bestowed upon Grøh by Orzal, the one who taught him swordsmanship.

Grøh’s dedication to his studies and training earned him a place as one of Aval’s Twelve. However, after his failure to deal with the Azure Knight, he lost his position within the organization. The infighting in Aval has delayed his punishment for now, and if Grøh hopes to protect his right to wield Arondight, he needs to once again prove just how strong he is.

Aval Dual-Swordsmanship
One of the fighting styles used by the Aval Organization’s combat personnel.

In the Middle Ages, most of the organization’s knights wore heavy armor, and primarily made use of shield, lance, and long sword techniques. However, as time passed and the organization transitioned into a secret society, the armor and weaponry became lighter, and the techniques more practical for agents engaged in clandestine operations. The ideal for Aval’s unique weaponry and fighting style dates to this transitional phase, and the style underwent multiple revisions before reaching its final form.

Unlike standard sword styles, Aval’s twinblade swordsmanship often employs multiple consecutive slashes. This has a major disadvantage in that a careless practitioner runs the risk of injuring themselves. As such, it takes a lot of practice to use this style effectively. Aval twinblade swordsmanship also allows for the swords to be split in two and wielded separately. This tactic is one of the many ways a wielder can use to surprise their opponent, giving them the opportunity to string together a series of blows that lead to a final, deadly slash.

Grøh disliked just one thing about Aval’s signature fighting style, and that was that its moves were never named. Therefore, he decided to come up with his own. The more conservative members of the organization objected, but Grøh was able to win them over in a few ways. First, he explained that names would allow the techniques to be passed on more easily. Second, by writing an extraordinarily detailed text describing the moves, and thirdly, by extensively researching appropriate names based on the Aval Organization’s deep-rooted traditions. In battle, he often shouts out a technique’s name, in the hopes that nearby allies may better learn and appreciate them.

Chevalier Mal Fet: Grøh performs a unveil move on his left eye, and does a overhead slash, shouting "You will be erased!". He then throws his saber at the opponent, teleports on him, slashes the target with double sabers, exclaiming "It ends here!". Uniting the sabers and charging with his malfested power, he chants "Chevalier...", stabs the opponent and do a upward slash, finishing the recite "...Mal Fet!". The move does 9 hits and its an easy-to-use critical edge that balances versatility and reach. It can be used in air combos, and to punish enemy when missed an attack. This move is mainly useful for increasing combo damage. More notably, it deals increases greatly during soul charge.
